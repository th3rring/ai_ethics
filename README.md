# AI Ethics - Team Automation Repository

# Installation
To keep things simple, I've setup a conda environment with all the dependencies for our project. If you need to install Conda, check out [this link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once installed, you'll need to create a new environment with the dependencies for this project. All of these have been specified in the ai_ethics.yml file (autogenerated by conda). From inside this repo, run `conda env create -f ai_ethics.yml` which will create a conda environment named _ai_ethics_.

To switch to this new environment, run `conda activate ai_ethics`. To install [URS](https://github.com/JosephLai241/URS), update the git submodule by running `git submodule update --init` and install using the _ai_ethics_ environment's pip:
1. Navigate to URS repo, `cd URS`
2. Install using env's pip, `conda run pip3 install . -r requirements.txt`

In order for URS's commands to work, you'll have to add your credentials by following [these instructions](https://github.com/JosephLai241/URS/blob/master/docs/How%20to%20Get%20PRAW%20Credentials.md).

# Usage
See the IPython Notebook files in the _notebooks_ directory. To open these, run `jupyer lab` from a terminal in the _ai_ethics_ environment. This'll launch a juypter lab session that will launch in your browser.
