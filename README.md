# AI Ethics - Team Automation Repository

# Installation
To keep things simple, I've setup a conda environment with all the dependencies for our project. If you need to install Conda, check out [this link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once installed, you'll need to create a new environment with the dependencies for this project. All of these have been specified in the ai_ethics.yml file (autogenerated by conda). From inside this repo, run `conda create -n ai_ethics --file ai_ethics.yml` which will create a conda environment named _ai_ethics_.

To switch to this new environment, run `conda activate ai_ethics`. And volia! Everything should be installed.
