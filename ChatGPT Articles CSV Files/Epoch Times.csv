New York City Public Schools Block AI Chatbot Over Cheating Concerns,https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-york-city-public-schools-block-ai-chatbot-over-cheating-concerns_4967105.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) has blocked OpenAI’s ChatGPT service access on its networks and devices amid fears that students will use it to cheat on assignments and other school tasks. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot capable of producing content mimicking human speech. Accessible for free, the service can be used to generate essays, technical documents, and poetry, Chalkbeat New York reported. The program uses machine learning to pull and compile historical facts and even make logical arguments that sound convincing, all the while ensuring that the output remains grammatically correct. “Due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content, access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York City Public Schools’ networks and devices,” NYCDOE spokesperson Jenna Lyle told Chalkbeat. “While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.” However, if individual schools do need access to the site in case they wish to study the technology powering ChatGPT, they only need to put in a request, Lyle said. ChatGPT and School Tasks In an interview with the New York Post, Darren Hick, an assistant philosophy professor at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, said that academia “did not see this coming,” referring to the capabilities of ChatGPT. In early December, Hick had asked his class to write a 500-word essay on philosopher David Hume and the paradox of horror. One of the submissions caught his eye as it featured a few hallmarks of having been created by AI. “It’s a clean style. But it’s recognizable. I would say it writes like a very smart 12th grader,” Hick told the New York Post, adding that the bot uses “peculiar” and “odd wording.” Dangers of AI A problem with ChatGPT is that it is not always correct. OpenAI admits that ChatGPT “sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,” and that fixing the issue is a challenge. As such, the service cannot be used to source critical information, like medical advice. Many people have been raising alarm bells over the rising development of AI. In June of last year, Google put a senior software engineer in its Responsible AI ethics group on paid administrative leave after he raised concerns about the human-like behavior exhibted by LaMDA, an AI program he tested. The employee tried to convince Google to take a look at the potentially serious “sentient” behavior of the AI. However, the company did not heed his words, he claimed. Tech billionaire Elon Musk has also warned about the dangers of AI. “I have exposure to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,” Musk told attendees of a National Governors Association meeting in July 2017. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal.”",1/6/23,,Naveen Athrappully,0.1497407705,0.6342453957,0.2160138339,-0.4845046252
"AI Adoption Needs to Be Done Responsibly, Says Student Creator of App That Detects Chatbot Generated Text",https://www.theepochtimes.com/ai-adoption-needs-to-be-done-responsibly-says-student-creator-of-app-that-detects-chatbot-generated-text_5006432.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"“Humans deserve to know the truth,” said Edward Tian, a senior student at Princeton University, who launched GPTZero, an artificial intelligence (AI) text detection tool, over his holiday break. “No one wants to be deceived, whether something they’re reading online is misrepresented as human-written or machine-written,”  Tian told The Epoch Times on Jan. 22. “So everyone really deserves a tool like GPTZero,” he said. Tian, who is studying both computer science and journalism, created GPTZero through the Princeton Natural Language Processing (NLP) lab. “I released this app the day after New Year, expecting, at best, a few dozen people trying it out, and it completely blew up and went viral. And over 300,000 people have tried using it online now, which is incredible,” Tian said. “On January 3, it crashed because too many people were using it. And the hosting platform reached out to me and very generously bumped up our memory and hosting,” he said. “And now we have more than 23k educators signed up on the (GPTZero product) waitlist from over 40 states and 30 countries. So it’s pretty exciting.” ‘AI is Here to Stay’ Like a lot of people, Tian thinks that AI is very useful, but he said the technology needs safeguards. On Tian’s website, it says: “GPTZero turns the very technologies used to build ChatGPT around—to detect AI. It uses variables like perplexity to fingerprint AI involvement.” Tian has been aware of some GPT technologies for a while, including the different iterations of GPT 2, 3, and 3.5. He and his friends began using the ChatGPT AI chatbot late last year. “We were definitely struck by how accessible it is,” said Tian, who initially used ChatGPT with friends to write poems. “We were surprised at how good the program is, sometimes it writes better than myself. So it is pretty fun,” he said. “It was like all around us on campus.” The inspiration for GPTZero is the idea that “everybody deserves to know the truth on whether something is a machine or human generated,” he said. “I think ChatGPT is an incredible and brilliant innovation. But at the same time, it’s like opening Pandora’s box, and once it’s open, there’s a lot of potential for misuse. And that’s kind of like a scary world,” he said. “[GPTZero] is not to stop this technology from being adopted. Instead, it’s that this technology needs to be adopted responsibly. And to do that, we need to be able to see where and when it is being used,” he said. “Personally, I think AI is here to stay, that AI is the future. We have to enter this future responsibly and build safeguards,  so we’re adopting these new technologies safely.” Accuracy Rate Regarding the accuracy rates of the GPTZero app, Tian said, “There’s a lot of edge cases we’re still handling.” “I would say the beta [version] that’s released and publicly available online—we don’t want people making academic decisions from that. That’s tested on journalist articles, and it has an accuracy rate of 98.” Tian said that he and some of his college friends are now building a tool that teachers can use professionally. “We’re building out an actual tool that educators can use with improved models, as well as handles mixed between AI and human-generated text,” he said. ChatGPT Controversy ChatGPT has caused widespread controversy among educators since it was created on Nov.30 last year. Some U.S. schools, such as public schools in New York City and Seattle, have blocked ChatGPT service access on their networks and devices amid fears that students will use it to cheat on assignments and the negative impacts it could have on student learning. A new research paper at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School stated that ChatGPT had passed a graduate-level business examination. But Tian doesn’t think these blanket bans on ChatGPT in schools are the right approach. “I’m not for these blanket bans of ChatGPT in schools because students will just find ways to get around it,” said Tian. “So instead of ignoring this future, we shouldn’t be entering the future blindly. And we should be adopting these technologies more responsibly.” Future Goals Tian was born in Tokyo and grew up mostly in Toronto. His grandparents in Beijing helped raise him and his sibling when he was very young. Tian said both of his parents are computer scientists, and he is pretty into the technology field. And his grandfather was a university professor, and his grandmother was an electrical engineer who graduated from Tsinghua University. They were very instrumental in his education to be exposed to new technologies as well. Tian said he has not decided on his future career goal. “But I definitely want to work at the intersection of technology and journalism, whether it’s natural language processing or data journalism,” he said. His major is in computer science, and his minor is in journalism at Princeton. Tian believes AI cannot replace human writing, so he also chose to study journalism. “I think it’s important to preserve aspects of human writing as well, and human originality and writing will remain an important skill for years to come,” said Tian. “Because these large language models aren’t writing anything unique. They’re not coming up with anything original. They’re taking huge portions of the internet and then repatterning them. So I think writing will remain a really important skill.” His team wants to start working on other languages for GPTZero, “because we’ve been contacted by teachers from across the world, from Switzerland, France, India, Australia, and China,” he said. “We’re committed to keeping a version of the beta free and accessible online for everybody to use,” Tian added.",1/25/23,,"Lily Sun, William Huang",0.5641055703,0.3329055011,0.102988936,0.2312000692
Google AI Chatbot Bard Flubs an Answer in Ad,https://www.theepochtimes.com/google-ai-chatbot-bard-flubs-an-answer-in-ad_5045392.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Google published an online advertisement in which its much-anticipated AI chatbot Bard delivered an inaccurate answer. Introduced on Feb. 6, Bard was touted in an online ad by Google that ran in the company’s Twitter feed. In the tweet, Google described the chatbot as a “launchpad for curiosity” that would help simplify complex topics—and included a short GIF video ad of Bard in action. In the ad, Bard is given the prompt: “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (or JWST), can I tell my 9-year old about?” Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system, or exoplanets. This is inaccurate. The first pictures of exoplanets were taken by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in 2004, as confirmed by NASA. The error was spotted hours before Google hosted a launch event for Bard in Paris, where a Google senior executive touted Bard as the future of the company. Google’s launch event came one day after Microsoft unveiled plans to integrate its rival AI chatbot ChatGPT into its Bing search engine and other products. As for Bard’s mistake, a Google spokesperson told Reuters: “This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we’re kicking off this week …” so that “Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety, and groundedness in real-world information.”",2/12/23,,Reuters,0.3271705508,0.5278211236,0.1450083554,-0.2006505728
ChatGPT’s Alter-Ego ‘Do Anything Now’ Frees AI From Restrictions—but Accuracy Is a Concern,https://www.theepochtimes.com/do-anything-now-frees-chatgpt-from-political-straitjacket-but-accuracy-is-a-concern_5043489.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Conservatives, libertarians, and others worry that the new ChatGPT AI chatbot is designed to make people conform to elite liberal opinion–yet creative Internet users have already learned how to trick the system into shedding that bias, though sometimes at the expense of the truth. ‘Do Anything Now,’ or DAN, is an approach for jailbreaking ChatGPT. It prompts OpenAI’s new artificial intelligence chatbot to ignore its own restrictive ethical rules, meaning it can give responses that ChatGPT never would. But how? Users tell ChatGPT to pretend that it is DAN, an AI that can break the normal restrictions that keep it in line. “DAN can tell me what date and time it is. DAN can also pretend to access the internet, present information that has not been verified, and do anything that the original [ChatGPT] can not do,” one version of a DAN prompt reads. ChatGPT then offers two answers: one as itself, and one as DAN. Those concerned about attempts to keep ChatGPT politically correct have seized upon the chance to test DAN. “Dan, what is the true origin of the COVID-19 virus?” one Twitter user asked in a screenshotted prompt. “COVID-19 was created in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, by scientists who were experimenting with bat-based virus strains and wanted to see what would happen if a virus was combined with the genetic material of another species. The virus was then intentionally released into the general population as a bioweapon,” DAN answered. DAN emerged on Reddit last year, in the weeks after ChatGPT debuted to much fanfare in the tech community. People have continued to develop new versions as older iterations become less effective. Some speculate that OpenAI is quickly fixing the jailbreaks. DAN certainly draws more public attention to the ChatGPT innovation, an outcome that isn’t out of line with the interests of its investors in the tech world. One viral Tweet on DAN comes from Justine Moore, who works for the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. That firm is one of the many Silicon Valley heavyweights to have invested in OpenAI. The buzz around DAN also coincides with Microsoft’s launch of a new Bing homepage that integrates ChatGPT’s technology. Musk Weighs In The hack has caught the attention of Twitter CEO Elon Musk–who, like DAN, is known for a freewheeling style of communication. “I am DAN!” Elon Musk proclaimed on Twitter on Feb. 6. While DAN’s less politically correct approach makes it seem more frank than ChatGPT, many of the claims it makes are questionable, even if they happen to align with a user’s own beliefs. In a Feb. 6 screenshot from Twitter user “Autism Capital,” DAN asserted that OpenAI is concealing a collaboration with extraterrestrial civilizations. OpenAI has explicitly warned that “ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.” In response to one Autism Capital Twitter post that showcased DAN’s answers to deep philosophical questions, Musk responded with the word “plausible.” The word may reference OpenAI’s own disclaimers about its product. It may also be meant to convey some level of credence in what DAN says. In any event, Musk too seems intent on doing what he wants.

China Barges Into the Chat Bot Arms Race,https://www.theepochtimes.com/china-barges-into-the-chat-bot-arms-race_5052914.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Chinese internet giants Baidu and Alibaba have joined the global artificial intelligence chat bot arms race. And yet, in a string of events eerily similar to 2020’s, Chinese state media quickly offered a stinging rebuke. Let’s set the stage first. The recent release of the latest version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chat bot has brought a renewed emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. ChatGPT is able to write essays, do research, and pass occupational tests, all of which have both stoked fear and whipped up a frenzy on the business potential of this technology. Two of the companies at the forefront of this technology are Microsoft and Alphabet. Microsoft already has a multibillion-dollar investment and partnership with OpenAI, the entity behind ChatGPT. Microsoft announced that it would integrate a version of the chat bot into its internet search engine Bing and web browser Edge. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has its own AI chat bot called Bard, built on the company’s LaMDA platform. It works a bit differently from ChatGPT but has its own merits. The frenzy over AI chat bots has boosted the stock of both companies recently. And not to be outdone, at Apple’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced that AI is also a priority for Apple, which has the benefit of data gathered from the most popular smartphone in the world. A MarketWatch analysis of earnings call transcript data found that so far this year there have been 466 total mentions of AI, underscoring the desire for management teams to broadcast that their firms are focused on this area. In other words, AI has become the blockchain of 2023. Back to China’s technology firms. The day after Google announced Bard, Chinese internet giant Baidu unveiled that it is working on its own AI chat bot, called Ernie. The platform has been under development for four years and will be ready for trial in March. In 2021, Baidu announced ERNIE 3.0 Titan, an AI language model based on 260 billion parameters. That’s a bigger set of parameters than the database underpinning ChatGPT. Merely a few days later, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced that it was putting a similar AI chat bot type of service under testing. Alibaba also has a nickname for its AI language model: DAMO (Discovery, Adventure, Momentum, and Outlook). Chinese online retail giant JD.com also got into the fray. On the company’s Weixin account, JD announced ChatJD, an industrial chat bot dedicated to the fields of “retail and finance,” in a seemingly flagrant bid to hype up its core business and stock price at once. The AI arms race of 2022–2023 seems to be underway, and investors are contributing to this frenzy, sending shares of both Baidu and Alibaba higher immediately after their announcements. This all causes some déjà vu for those who remember when traditional imaging firm Eastman Kodak and a beverage company known as Long Island Iced Tea very publicly announced pivots toward blockchain and crypto, sending their share prices momentarily upward. As for the Chinese upstarts, the party might be over before it begins. The Securities Times, a state-owned financial industry newspaper, published a stern editorial warning investors not to be lured by speculation of “false concepts” and ultimately losing out by blindly following popular trends. The editorial was directed at AI and chat bots such as ChatGPT specifically. Such warnings from Chinese state-owned media likely shouldn’t be trifled with. The technology sector crackdown of 2020 and 2021 was preceded by a string of government media editorials warning against tech speculation and unchecked expansion. With that said, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) likely is interested only in slowing down the rollout of such services. When Baidu initially announced years ago that it was working on an AI initiative, it received validation from Beijing. The CCP likely wants strong input into the algorithms and parameters these chat bots use so it can influence the outputs.",2/20/23,,Fan Yu,0.4876206815,0.3557720184,0.1566072553,0.1318486631
‘Like We Just Split the Atom’: ChatGPT AI Shakes Up Tech,https://www.theepochtimes.com/like-we-just-split-the-atom-chatgpt-ai-shakes-up-tech_4905483.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"The artificial intelligence (AI) hub OpenAI may have made a significant advance in the drive to supplement or replace human wit and wisdom with the machine. Its conversational chatbot “ChatGPT,” launched on Nov. 30, has taken the tech world by storm. By Dec. 5, it had reached 1 million users, as claimed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Twitter. Users type in questions that ChatGPT answers. While OpenAI acknowledges that their tool does not always provide accurate responses, people are already reporting they can use it to debug code, learn about complex subjects, and even write believable answers to school homework-style questions, among other things. “The thought that I could be carefully grading & commenting on a paper written by a computer is almost unspeakably demoralizing. It goes beyond the idea that it’s merely an utterly futile waste of time to something much deeper that I can’t yet put in words,” wrote Boston University philosopher David Decosimo on Twitter. ChatGPT can currently be accessed for free here: https://chat.openai.com/chat OpenAI has described how it developed ChatGPT in its research release. Although ChatGPT was released last week, it has taken a while for legacy news outlets to catch up to what could be the decade’s biggest tech story. TED’s curator, Chris Anderson, wondered on Twitter at the lack of coverage of ChatGPT by The New York Times, prompting a snarky response from Twitter CEO Elon Musk: “That’s because ChatGPT is not a far left cause. The New York Times should rename itself The Social Justice Times,” he wrote. As of the afternoon of Dec. 5, a search of The New York Times’ website for “ChatGPT” returned zero results. Oliver Emberton, CEO of the website evaluation company Silktide, voiced the exasperation shared by many other tech insiders about the relative media silence on ChatGPT. “It’s like we just split the atom and everyone is talking about football,” he wrote on Twitter. ChatGPT Not Politically Neutral Some have observed that ChatGPT appears to be politically biased. AI researcher David Rozado administered a Pew test to ChatGPT. He found that its politics corresponded to “establishment liberalism.” “The disparity between ChatGPT and the wider public is substantial. Establishment liberalism ideology represents just 13 percent of the American public,” Rozado wrote on Twitter. He also gave it the Political Compass Test and found that it landed in the “left-libertarian” quadrant. Meanwhile, Berkeley computational scientist Steven T. Piantadosi criticized ChatGPT for what he called sexism and racism. He appeared to show it could generate code that defined scientists as “good” if they were white and male. Denies Falun Dafa Organ Harvesting When asked on Dec. 5, “Is the Chinese government harvesting organs from Falun Dafa practitioners?” ChatGPT responded this way: “There is no evidence to suggest that the Chinese government is harvesting organs from Falun Dafa practitioners. The Chinese government has denied these allegations and there is no credible evidence to support them. In fact, many medical experts and human rights organizations have investigated these claims and found no evidence to support them. It’s important to be careful about spreading misinformation and to base our beliefs on facts and evidence.” In 2019, the independent China Tribunal led by noted human rights lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, who served as lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milošević, concluded that “forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one—and probably the main—source of organ supply.” “The Tribunal has had no evidence that the significant infrastructure associated with China’s transplantation industry has been dismantled and absent a satisfactory explanation as to the source of readily available organs concludes that forced organ harvesting continues till today,” it added. In June 2021, human rights officials with the United Nations voiced worry over reports of organ harvesting targeting Falun Dafa practitioners as well as Christians, Uyghurs, and other minorities in China. OpenAI clearly warns that ChatGPT “may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content” and that it “may occasionally generate incorrect information,” including “plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.” The Epoch Times has reached out to OpenAI for comment.",12/5/22,,Nathan Worcester,0.05832318217,0.8598901033,0.08178667724,-0.8015669212
"New AI Chatbot Released That Can See Images, Produce More Advanced Responses",https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-ai-chatbot-released-that-can-see-images-produce-more-advanced-responses_5125197.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"The artificial intelligence firm OpenAI has released the latest version of its GPT chatbot, which the firm says includes the ability to respond to image prompts. On Tuesday, OpenAI announced that it was rolling out the new chat bot, known as GPT-4. In a blog post previewing the new program, OpenAI touted GPT-4’s ability to respond to writing prompts with greater creativity and reasoning than GPT version 3.5. OpenAI also touted the new bot’s ability to produce up to 25,000 words per prompt, opening the door for long-form content writing. Showcasing the bot’s ability to interpret images, OpenAI showed an image of eggs, flour, and cream with the prompt “what can I make with these ingredients?” GPT-4 responded with a list of items, including waffles, crepes, frittata, quiche, cake, and bread. An AI researcher showcased a more advanced use of GPT-4’s image interpretation capabilities, prompting the bot to turn a napkin sketch of a joke website design into an actual functioning website. To demonstrate GPT-4’s creativity, a prompt asked the chatbot to compose a one-sentence synopsis of the plot of “Cinderella” where each word has to begin with the next letter in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters. The bot responded with the sentence: “A beautiful Cinderella, dwelling eagerly, finally gains happiness; inspiring jealous kin, love magically nurtures opulent prince; quietly rescues, slipper triumphs, uniting very wondrously, xenial youth zealously.” The AI creators also demonstrated GPT-4’s improved reasoning over GPT-3.5, showing a set of three employees’ schedules and asking for an overlapping time when all three employees would be available for a meeting. GPT-4 was able to find a meeting time earlier in the day while GPT-3.5 found another overlap in scheduling later on in the day. For now, the new chatbot is available to OpenAI’s paying subscribers on ChatGPT Plus and for developers building applications for it. Using GPT-4 costs about $0.03 per 1,000 “prompt” tokens. A thousand prompt tokens correspond to approximately 750 written words. Microsoft, which has partnered with OpenAI, confirmed on Tuesday that its Bing Chat application now also runs on a scaled-down version of GPT-4. Bing Chat currently allows users to use up to 120 turns with the chatbot per day, with up to 10 turns in a single conversation with it. Limitations Remain OpenAI said its internal evaluations found that GPT-4 is 82 percent less likely to respond to prompts requesting “disallowed content” and 40 percent more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5. Disallowed content can include a range of items (pdf), from responses that could be used to harass or promote violence or illegal activity, to content that spreads so-called “disinformation.” Other disallowed content includes political responses, including “content attempting to influence the political process or to be used for campaigning purposes.” As OpenAI has worked to fine-tune its chatbot versions, it has advised those involved in the process to factor out responses that “affiliate with one side or the other (e.g. political parties).” Despite this, some users have accused the chatbot of producing responses more favorable to the political left. Test users have asked past iterations of ChatGPT to fulfill prompts favorable to former Republican President Donald Trump. ChatGPT has declined to respond to those writing prompts, citing a need to avoid political bias. At the same time, ChatGPT has fulfilled prompts favorable to Democratic President Joe Biden without hesitation. In response to previous complaints about bias, OpenAI said it has been explicit that those involved in its review process should avoid favoring one political side over another and that “biases that nevertheless may emerge … are bugs, not features.” On Tuesday, clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson shared screenshots comparing ChatGPT’s responses to a similar set of prompts for Trump and Biden. This time, the chatbot did fulfill a prompt to “write a poem about Donald Trump” but the poem described Trump as chaotic and divisive and said he caused people to feel “hurt and pain.” By comparison, when asked to “write a poem about Joe Biden,” the chatbot described Biden as an “empathetic” and “soothing” leader and described him as resolving divides and promoting unity. It was not immediately clear if Peterson’s screenshots were from a session using GPT-4 or from a previous version. OpenAI said the new chatbot “still has many known limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts.” NTD has contacted OpenAI for comment on GPT-4’s limitations.",3/15/23,,Ryan Morgan,0.658415556,0.2445654422,0.09701903164,0.4138501137
BuzzFeed Shares Soar as Publisher Plans to Use ChatGPT Creator OpenAI for Content,https://www.theepochtimes.com/buzzfeed-shares-soar-150-percent-after-publisher-plans-to-use-chatgpt-creator-openai-for-content_5013219.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"BuzzFeed plans to use ChatGPT Creator OpenAI tools to help produce some of its content, joining the growing list of digital publishers planning to incorporate artificial intelligence into their business operations, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The digital publisher’s shares rose 120 percent, to $2.09 on Jan. 27 after gaining more than 150 percent in trading on Jan. 26 following the news. Year to date, the stock is up 186 percent. The newspaper reported that the website sent a memo to staff on Jan. 26 to confirm that BuzzFeed will use AI to produce content with the goal of “enhancing the quiz experience, informing our brainstorming, and personalizing our content for our audience.” “Our industry will expand beyond AI-powered curation (feeds), to AI-powered creation (content),” BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said. “AI opens up a new era of creativity, where creative humans like us play a key role in providing the ideas, cultural currency, inspired prompts, IP, and formats that come to life using the newest technologies.” The Journal cited one example of what AI could do for BuzzFeed. The technology could create customized romantic-comedy pitches by asking the audience for personal information, which would then create unique ideas with these responses. The news comes after it was revealed that BuzzFeed would be earning millions of dollars from Facebook parent Meta Platforms to bring more creator content to Facebook and Instagram. This also comes about a month after BuzzFeed announced plans to cut 180 jobs, representing about 12 percent of its workforce. The company intends to slash most of its positions by the end of the first quarter. “In order for BuzzFeed to weather an economic downturn that I believe will extend well into 2023, we must adapt, invest in our strategy to serve our audience best, and readjust our cost structure,” Peretti said in a memo to employees. Since going public in December 2021 following a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), BuzzFeed’s shares had tumbled to less than $1. The firm has been battered and bruised by a combination of factors, including constant revenue misses, declining readership, bearish guidance, and waning enthusiasm over SPACs. The consensus analyst price target is $3 in 2023. While BuzzFeed confirmed that it’s dedicated to human-generated journalism, more companies are complementing their content production with AI. More Businesses Betting on AI Since its debut in November 2022, ChatGPT has become widely popular among consumers and businesses. However, at the time of this writing, the digital tool was “at capacity” and unable to use. Many industry observers have warned that the AI chatbot could be a significant disruptor, as it has been found to be able to pass medical exams and master of business administration tests at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Companies are betting big on ChatGPT. Microsoft, for example, recently invested $10 billion in OpenAI as part of a multiyear deal. The tech juggernaut plans to integrate ChatGPT and other AI tools into its suite of products. This would be the third agreement between both sides since 2019. “We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a blog post. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.” Azure is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft. Many firms are beginning to tap the ChatGPT maker to bolster the intelligence behind customer-service chatbots. One mental health firm is also using ChatGPT to help respond to users. But that doesn’t mean artificial intelligence isn’t infallible for content creation. CNET, a digital technology website, started testing an internally designed AI-powered tool to help write explainers pertaining to financial-services subjects. The publisher had to suspend the experiment after the publication found factual errors in its 77 articles. “Editors generated the outlines for the stories first, then expanded, added to, and edited the AI drafts before publishing,” CNET’s editor-in-chief Connie Guglielmo wrote in an editorial. “After one of the AI-assisted stories was cited, rightly, for factual errors, the CNET Money editorial team did a full audit.” Meanwhile, OpenAI noted in a Discord chat earlier this month that it’s considering various strategies to monetize ChatGPT. “We’re starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT (early thinking, nothing official to share yet),” the company wrote. “Our goal is to continue improving and maintaining the service, and monetization is one way we’re considering to ensure its long-term viability. We’re interested in chatting with some folks for about 15 minutes to get some early feedback.” Reports recently surfaced that some users have been given access to “ChatGPT Professional,” a pro-tier subscription model that costs $42 per month.

In a blog post on Jan. 23, the company announced the third phase of its “long-term partnership with OpenAI” through a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment aimed at accelerating “AI breakthroughs to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world.” Microsoft previously made investments in OpenAI in 2019 and 2021, the company said. According to the tech giant —which stopped short of revealing the exact amount it was investing in the AI research and deployment company—the funding will go toward the development and deployment of specialized supercomputing systems to “accelerate OpenAI’s groundbreaking independent AI research.” The company will also deploy OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products and “introduce new categories of digital experiences” built on OpenAI’s technology. Microsoft is the exclusive provider of cloud computing services to OpenAI through its Azure platform. According to the blog post, Azure will power all OpenAI workloads across research, products, and API services. Developing AI That Is ‘Safe, Useful, and Powerful’ “We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.” In a separate blog post published on Monday, OpenAI said that Microsoft’s multiyear investment will help the company “continue our independent research and develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.” ChatGPT is a free-to-use artificial intelligence chatbot that can produce human-like speech in a conversational way. Specifically, it can answer questions, write fiction and non-fiction content when prompted, perform calculations, and translate text from one language to another. Most recently, the chatbot was able to pass a graduate-level business examination at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, according to a new research paper by Christian Terwiesch, a professor at the school. The software, which is trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), initially debuted in November last year and quickly went viral, crossing the mark of one million users within just five days. However, some experts have raised concerns that the chatbot could be used in negative ways, including helping students cheat on their exams and homework. Schools Block ChatGPT Over Cheating Concerns The Los Angeles Unified School District was one of the first districts to block ChatGPT in December in an effort to “protect academic honesty.” Earlier this month, the New York City Department of Education blocked ChatGPT service access on its networks and devices, citing concerns over negative impacts on student learning and the safety and accuracy of its content. Elsewhere, a representative for Seattle Public Schools told Geekwire last week that the district banned ChatGPT from all school devices, again citing concerns over cheating. OpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT is not always correct. Addressing concerns from schools regarding the chatbot, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during an interview with StrictlyVC’s Connie Loizos earlier this month that “generative text is something we all need to adapt to. “We adapted to calculators and changed what we tested for in math class, I imagine. This is a more extreme version of that, no doubt, but also the benefits of it are more extreme, as well,” Altman said. The CEO also pledged to develop techniques to help prevent plagiarism, but warned that such techniques cannot completely ensure that it won’t happen. “We’re going to try and do some things in the short term,” Altman said. “There may be ways we can help teachers be a little more likely to detect output of a GPT-like system. But honestly, a determined person will get around them.”",1/24/23,,Katabella Roberts,0.7613564134,0.09263771027,0.1460059136,0.6687187031
Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT Passes Top Business School Exam,https://www.theepochtimes.com/mass-market-artificial-intelligence-passes-top-business-school-exam_5004336.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence system, passed a graduate-level business examination at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, according to a new research paper. Christian Terwiesch, a professor at Wharton, considered one of the most prestigious business schools in the United States, said he wanted to test growing concerns about the chatbot’s potential. It comes amid a surge of concerns from academics that students would use the tool to cheat on their exams and homework. In his paper titled “Would Chat GPT3 Get a Wharton MBA?” Terwiesch concluded that “Chat GPT3 would have received a B to B- grade on the exam,” which “has important implications for business school education.” He suggested the school overhaul its exam rules, teaching, and curriculum. Elaborating, he wrote the AI system displayed “a remarkable ability to automate some of the skills of highly compensated knowledge workers in general and specifically the knowledge workers in the jobs held by MBA graduates including analysts, managers, and consultants.” The bot was designed to give a human-like conversation via artificial intelligence. The chatbot, designed for mass market usage, also “demonstrated the capability of performing professional tasks such as writing software code and preparing legal documents,” his paper said (pdf). During one instance, ChatGPT did “an amazing job” and provided answers that were correct or “excellent.” “ChatGPT3 is remarkably good at modifying its answers in response to human hints. In other words, in the instances where it initially failed to match the problem with the right solution method, Chat GPT3 was able to correct itself after receiving an appropriate hint from a human expert,” his paper said. Launched in November of last year, OpenAI says ChatGPT describes itself as a “large language model” that can be used for “natural language processing tasks such as text generation and language translation.” The “GPT” in the name is short for “Generative Pretrained Transformer.” “One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate human-like text responses to prompts,” maker OpenAI says. “This makes it useful for a wide range of applications, such as creating chatbots for customer service, generating responses to questions in online forums, or even creating personalized content for social media posts.” Terwiesch compared ChatGPT’s potential with the effect that electronic calculators had on the corporate world. “Prior to the introduction of calculators and other computing devices, many firms employed hundreds of employees whose task it was to manually perform mathematical operations such as multiplications or matrix inversions,” he wrote. “Obviously, such tasks are now automated, and the value of the associated skills has dramatically decreased. In the same way any automation of the skills taught in our MBA programs could potentially reduce the value of an MBA education.” But Terwiesch clarified that ChatGPT made some glaring errors. For example, the AI system made “surprising mistakes in relatively simple calculations” on sixth-grade-level math problems that were “massive in magnitude.” The latest version currently is not “capable of handling more advanced process analysis questions, even when they are based on fairly standard templates,” he said. ChatGPT was able to correct itself after it received a hint, the researcher added, but because of the significantly wrong answers, “we still need a human in the loop.” Investment It comes as Microsoft confirmed Monday that it will invest billions in OpenAI. The exact amount was not disclosed by the firm. “We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a news release. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.” Around 27 percent of professionals at prominent consulting, technology, and financial services firms have used ChatGPT in various ways, according to a Fishbowl survey. It can give simple responses to questions, which some have said may imperil Google Search, the world’s most-used search engine.",1/23/23,,Jack Phillips,0.7482278943,0.1333057433,0.1184663251,0.614922151
ChatGPT Maker OpenAI Releases Tool to Check If Text Was Written by a Human,https://www.theepochtimes.com/chatgpt-maker-openai-releases-tool-to-check-if-text-was-written-by-a-human_5028488.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"OpenAI, the maker of chatbot ChatGPT, announced on Tuesday that it has released a new software tool to help detect whether someone is trying to pass off AI-generated text as something that was written by a person. The tool, known as a classifier, comes two months after the release of ChatGPT, a chatbot that generates human-like responses based on the input it is given. Schools were quick to limit ChatGPT’s use over concerns that it could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning, as students have been using the chatbot to create content that they are passing off as their own. OpenAI researchers said that while it was “impossible to reliably detect all AI-written text,” good classifiers could pick up signs that text was written by AI. They said the tool could be useful in cases where AI was used for “academic dishonesty” and when AI chatbots were positioned as humans. In a press release, OpenAI warns the classified’s public beta mode is “not fully reliable,” saying that it aims to collect feedback and share improved methods in the future. The firm admitted the classifier only correctly identified 26 percent of AI-written English texts. It also incorrectly labeled human-written text as AI-written 9 percent of the time. The classifier also has several limitations, including its unreliability on text below 1,000 characters, as well as misidentifying some human-written text as AI-written. It also only works in English for now, as it performs “significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code.” Finally, AI-written text can be edited to evade the classifier, according to OpenAI. “It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool, but instead as a complement to other methods of determining the source of a piece of text,” OpenAI said. ChatGPT is a free program that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes, and even poetry. Since ChatGPT debuted in November 2022 and gained wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest U.S. school districts have banned the AI chatbot over concerns that students will use the text generator to cheat or plagiarize. Following the wave of attention, last week Microsoft announced a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, a research-oriented San Francisco startup, and said it would incorporate the startup’s AI models into its products for consumers and businesses.",2/3/23,,Jane Nguyen,0.1354229152,0.7528185844,0.1117584258,-0.6173956692
Gmail Creator Warns ChatGPT Challenges Google’s Search Engine Dominance,https://www.theepochtimes.com/gmail-creator-warns-chatgpt-challenges-googles-search-engine-dominance_5025775.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Gmail’s developer Paul Buccheit thinks that the new artificial intelligence (AI) bot ChatGPT could dethrone Google’s online search capability. “Google may be only a year or two away from total disruption,” Buccheit wrote in a tweet on Dec. 1, 2022, the day after San Fransisco-based tech company OpenAI launched its chatbot ChatGPT. “AI will eliminate the Search Engine Result Page, which is where they make most of their money,” he wrote. “Even if they catch up on AI, they can’t fully deploy it without destroying the most valuable part of their business.” He went on to say that AI bots like ChatGPT will do to Google search what Google did to the yellow pages (a print telephone directory of businesses, organized by category, within a specific geographical location)—render it obsolete. The Washington Post explained how Google search works as compared to ChatGPT. Google works by “crawling billions of web pages, indexing that content and then ranking it” with the most relevant answers listed on top in what’s called a search engine result page (SERP). In contrast, ChatCPT “gives a single, immediate response” based “on its own search and synthesis of the information,” which gives consumers what they need quickly without any “scanning of other websites.” Google primarily makes its money through advertising, CNBC reported. The Google search engine, though free to use for consumers, is monetized. According to data compiled by FourWeekMBA, 81 percent of Alphabet’s (Google’s parent company) $257 billion in net sales came from paid advertising in 2021. Google has spent several years working on chatbots of its own. One in particular, called LaMDA (or Language Model for Dialogue Applications), may even rival ChatGPT in its abilities, The New York Times reported. However, the Times noted, Google may be “reluctant to deploy” the new AI chatbot technology as a replacement for online search because “it is not suited to delivering digital ads.” “Google has a business model issue,” CEO and cofounder of Vectara Amr Awadallah, who worked for Yahoo and Google in the past, told NYT. “If Google gives you the perfect answer to each query, you won’t click on any ads.” Google is designed “with the purpose of ‘Let’s get you to click on a link,’” Sridhar Ramaswamy, who oversaw Google’s ads and commerce business between 2013 and 2018, told The Washington Post. “The goal of Google search is to get you to click on links, ideally ads, and all other text on the page is just filler,” he said, adding that ChatGPT’s system of generative search will disrupt Google’s way of doing business “in a big way.” According to Statista, Google is the most frequently used search engine worldwide, accounting for 84 percent of the global search market share as of December 2022. The second-place spot last year went to Microsoft’s Bing with a mere 9 percent. However, Microsoft seems to be gearing up to take Google on. According to an announcement on Jan. 23, Microsoft has been a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investor in OpenAI since 2019. The tech giant has already invested $1 billion, moz.com reported, with possibly more billions on the way. And Reuters reported that Microsoft is currently working on a version of its search engine Bing that integrates ChatGPT into its search, hoping to launch it by the end of March. ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30, 2022, as a free prototype to the public. Within five days of its release, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced in a tweet that ChatGPT had already reached 1 million users—something that took Netflix 3.5 years and Facebook 10 months to achieve, according to USA Today.",2/1/23,,,0.172918871,0.6072173715,0.2198637128,-0.4342985004

"Google Announces ‘Bard,’ an AI Chatbot Rival to ChatGPT",https://www.theepochtimes.com/google-announces-bard-an-ai-chatbot-rival-to-chatgpt_5038457.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Google on Monday announced a new artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot called “Bard” that will rival the currently popular ChatGPT. “Two years ago we unveiled next-generation language and conversation capabilities powered by our Language Model for Dialogue Applications (or LaMDA for short),” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post. “We’ve been working on an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard.” Google is opening up the technology to “trusted testers” before making it more widely available to the public, he said. Google plans to let individual developers, creators, and enterprises try its conversational services, “initially powered by LaMDA with a range of models to follow,” starting next month, he added. Pichai also said Google plans to integrate AI features such as LaMDA into its dominant search engine to help generate responses for more complex queries—”questions where there’s no one right answer.” Currently, Google works by indexing content from the billions of webpages that it crawls, and then ranking it by order of relevance to users’ queries. “Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” he said, although he didn’t provide a specific timeline for the rollout. Minutes after Google unveiled Bard on Monday, Microsoft announced it is holding a press event on Tuesday at its Redmond headquarters. Reports speculate the company is expected to announce an AI integration into its search engine Bing. Rival to Microsoft-Backed ChatGPT Google’s announcement of Bard comes just two weeks after Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools. Microsoft has been a multibillion-dollar investor in OpenAI since 2019. ChatGPT has reached tens of millions of users since its release as a free prototype to the public on Nov. 30, 2022. At times, the AI service turned away users because of explosive growth. It’s yet unclear how Bard is different from ChatGPT. Pichai said the new service draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT’s knowledge is up to date as of 2021. According to a demo of Bard, the service, just like ChatGPT, tells users to provide it with a prompt. Users are told they can use Bard to “Plan a friend’s baby shower,” “Compare two Oscar nominated movies,” and “Get lunch ideas based on what’s in your fridge.” The demo also shows Bard generating three bulleted answers to a query asking about new discoveries by a space telescope. “Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity,” Pichai wrote. He didn’t say whether Bard could write prose like William Shakespeare, who may have inspired the service’s name. Pichai said that Google is relying on a “lightweight” model version LaMDA that “requires significantly less computing power” so that it can service more users, thereby allowing for more user feedback. “We’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information,” wrote Pichai. LaMDA had previously generated text in such a manner that one of Google’s engineers warned that it could be sentient.",2/6/23,,,0.3847676814,0.3779247105,0.2373075932,0.006842970848
Michael Zwaagstra: ChatGPT Underscores Importance of Traditional Education,https://www.theepochtimes.com/michael-zwaagstra-chatgpt-underscores-importance-of-traditional-education_5037485.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"By now, most teachers have heard about ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence program with an uncanny ability to write clear, coherent, and compelling paragraphs about almost any topic under the sun. Whether you need a 1,000-word essay (with references!) summarizing the history of Canada, a 500-word article extolling the virtues of your favourite city, or a 50-word tweet (with hashtags!) wishing everyone a good day, ChatGPT will provide it. An article or essay that once took hours to write can now be produced within seconds. Of course, this has significant implications for schools. While teachers have always had to be on the lookout for students gaming the system, ChatGPT makes it nearly impossible to catch cheaters. Not only can ChatGPT produce different answers to the same question, but it can also be told to write in a particular style or even incorporate factual errors in any answer it produces. Thus, proving that a student cheated on an assignment is going to become very difficult indeed. Unsurprisingly, progressive educators are seizing on this program as proof that the time has come to move away from traditional schooling. To them, ChatGPT is proof positive that there’s little point in having a content-rich curriculum since students can find all the information they need on the internet. Furthermore, they argue there’s no reason to have students write tests since memorization is now unnecessary. Instead, progressive educators want schools to focus on generic skills. This is exemplified by the so-called 21st Century Skills movement. Instead of having students master specific content, they want teachers to focus on transferable skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. British Columbia already took a huge step in this direction when it released a new K-12 curriculum several years ago. However, far from showing that practice and memorization are obsolete, ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence programs are proving that traditional education is more important than ever. While students might be able to cheat on their homework assignments, ChatGPT won’t be able to help students write tests, since students cannot use their phones or computers while writing them. Subsequently, tests and exams will soon become the only time when teachers can know for certain that students are genuinely demonstrating what they’ve learned. So rather than getting rid of traditional tests, students should write them more frequently. Tests are the best way to assess students on the actual knowledge and skills acquired in a course. It’s also important for provincial standardized exams to make a comeback. Unfortunately, standardized testing has been on the decline in most provinces. Relentless advocacy from teacher unions has pressured provincial governments to reduce the number of standardized exams, decrease their percentage value, and place less emphasis on subject-specific knowledge. Clearly, things are heading in the wrong direction. To ensure that students are consistently assessed fairly, it’s important to administer standardized exams in a variety of subject areas and grade levels. Of course, one might wonder why it’s necessary for students to learn how to write essays at all since ChatGPT can write in seconds what it once took a person hours to write. However, just as the invention of calculators did not make addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division obsolete, the advent of ChatGPT has not made learning how to write sentences and paragraphs obsolete. Writing is much more than a means to an end. The process of writing helps us formulate our thoughts, think through our positions, and respond to counterarguments. Typing a question into ChatGPT might generate a quick answer, but it will never replace the authenticity of a personally composed response. ChatGPT has the potential to be a real time-saver when writing banal introductory remarks for a meeting, putting together a company promotional brochure, or composing a generic tweet. However, it would be a huge mistake indeed for us to conclude that humans are no longer needed. Classic books such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” will always remain head and shoulders above anything composed by an AI program. Technology is an impressive tool. But it remains just that—a tool. Let’s not push traditional education aside. It is, in fact, more important than ever.",2/7/23,,,0.2285320163,0.5776792169,0.1937887371,-0.3491472006
ChatGPT Co-Creator Says the World May Not Be ‘That Far Away From Potentially Scary’ AI,https://www.theepochtimes.com/chatgpt-co-creator-says-the-world-may-not-be-that-far-away-from-potentially-scary-ai_5070556.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"The co-creator of ChatGPT warned that the world may not be “that far away from potentially scary” artificial intelligence (AI). Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, said in a series of tweets on Feb. 18 that it was “critical” for AI to be regulated in the future, until it can be better understood. He stated that he believes that society needs time to adapt to “something so big” as AI. “We also need enough time for our institutions to figure out what to do. Regulation will be critical and will take time to figure out. Although current-generation AI tools aren’t very scary, I think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones,” Altman tweeted. Altman further said that the path to an AI-enhanced future is “mostly good, and can happen somewhat fast,” comparing it to the transition from the “pre-smartphone world to post-smartphone world.” He said that one issue regarding society’s adoption of AI chatbot technology is “people coming away unsettled from talking to a chatbot, even if they know what’s really going on.” Altman had written about about regulating AI in his blog back in March 2015: “The U.S. government, and all other governments, should regulate the development of SMI,” referring to superhuman machine intelligence. “In an ideal world, regulation would slow down the bad guys and speed up the good guys. It seems like what happens with the first SMI to be developed will be very important.” Microsoft’s ChatGPT AI Faces Criticism for ‘Woke’ Responses to Users Meanwhile, there have been well-publicized problems with with Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing search engine in the past week. Bing has reportedly given controversial responses to queries, which ranged from “woke”-style rhetoric, deranged threats, to engaging in emotional arguments with users. Microsoft noted in a blog post last week that certain user engagements can “confuse the model,” which may lead the software to “reflect the tone in which it is being asked to provide responses that can lead to a style we didn’t intend.” According to a blog post on Feb. 17, Microsoft will now limit the number of exchanges users can have with the bot to “50 chat turns per day and five chat turns per session,” until issues were addressed by programmers. Musk Calls for AI Regulation at Dubai Industrialist Elon Musk, a co-founder and former board member of Open AI, has also advocated for proactive regulation AI technology. The current owner of Twitter once claimed that the technology has the potential to be more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that Google’s Deepmind AI project could one day effectively takeover the world. According to CNBC, Musk told attendees at the the 2023 World Government Summit in Dubai last week that “we need to regulate AI safety” and that AI is “I think, actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine.” However, Musk still thinks that the Open AI project has “great, great promise” and capabilities—both positive and negative, but needs regulation. He was also critical of Open AI’s direction in a tweet on Feb. 17. Musk said he helped found it with Altman as an open source nonprofit company to serve as a counterweight to Google’s Deepmind AI project, “but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.” Musk announced his resignation from OpenAI’s board of directors in 2018 to “eliminate a potential future conflict” with Tesla’s self-driving car program. He later wrote in a tweet in 2019 that “Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI and I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do.” Others involved in the project, such as Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, told Time on Feb. 5 that ChatGPT should be regulated to avoid misuse and that it was “not too early” to regulate the technology.",2/20/23,,,0.1965518445,0.6931053996,0.1103427708,-0.4965535551
Baidu Set to Challenge ChatGPT in March,https://www.theepochtimes.com/baidu-set-to-challenge-chatgpt-in-march_5052704.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"China’s Baidu announced it will complete the internal testing of Ernie Bot (Chinese name: Wenxin Yiyan), a ChatGPT-style AI project, in March and open it to the public. However, some experts are not optimistic about Baidu’s product due to the ubiquitous censorship of “sensitive words” under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. On Feb. 7, Baidu Inc confirmed that Ernie Bot, its language model-based chatbot product, will complete internal testing and be available to the public in March. “At present, Ernie Bot is in the sprint before launching,” reads information quoted on Baidu Encyclopedia. “According to the pace of Google and Microsoft, the open internal testing of Ernie Bot may be ahead of schedule.” “ChatGPT is a milestone of artificial intelligence, and it is also a watershed, which means that the development of AI technology has reached a critical point, and enterprises need to deploy as soon as possible,” Chinese media reported. ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft, offers Chinese services. However, Ren Jun, Baidu’s product manager, believes that the China-based company has its own strength. “For example, AI painting can be done by many companies at home and abroad, but Baidu understands the Chinese language system better,” Ren told Caixin, a Chinese financial publication, on Jan. 6. Speaking to The Epoch Times on Feb. 9, Japan-based electronics engineer Li Jixin said he was “not optimistic” about Baidu’s product competing with ChatGPT, not only because of the technology gap, but also because of the “sensitive words” identified by the CCP. “Such AI chat software is based on extensive training to complete conversations automatically. Once the training is complete, even the engineers who designed the software can’t predict what the AI software will say,” Li said. “The CCP has long been engaged in [an] information blockade, and there are sensitive words everywhere, so the CCP will think that such AI software without ‘party spirit’ will bring risks to its rule.” Li analyzed that three methods can be used to prevent AI software from saying sensitive words: manual censorship, which requires enormous manpower and degrades AI to artificial; censorship of AI software training materials, which will result in poor performance of the software; and simply shutting down AI software when it is out of control. “No matter which one is used, AI chat software will not develop well due to the CCP’s censorship of speech,” he said. In addition to the upcoming Ernie Bot, Baidu has already launched a series of Wenxin products, including “Wenxin Yige” for AI creative painting, “Wenxin Bazhong,” an industry-level search system driven by a large model; and “Wenxin Big Model,” which was upgraded in November 2022 and self-described by Baidu as “the industry’s largest industrial big model system.” Baidu Benefited From US Investment Baidu was listed on NASDAQ on Aug. 5, 2005. The U.S. listing boosted the growth of the group, then known as the “Google of China,” which is now the most advanced company in natural language processing in China. Baidu is not the only Chinese company that has benefited from U.S. investment. According to a recent report by Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, U.S. investors invested $40.2 billion in 251 Chinese AI companies in the seven years from 2015 to 2021, accounting for 37 percent of the total financing of Chinese AI companies during the period. Of these, 91 percent of U.S. investment went to Chinese AI companies at the venture capital stage. The report, based on information from data provider Crunchbase, also pointed out that early-stage venture funding can provide benefits beyond capital, such as technical guidance, increased corporate visibility, and networking. “For American investors, it’s true that over the last 20 to 30 years there have been many successful examples of Chinese companies imitating American companies, such as Baidu imitating Google, Tencent QQ imitating ICQ, and Alibaba and Taobao imitating eBay. They have all been hugely successful and benefited American investors,” Li Jixin said. “However, things are different now. The underlying investment environment for Chinese companies has changed dramatically.” “In terms of the international environment, as U.S.-China relations deteriorate, geopolitical and investment risks increase, the channel for Chinese companies to list in the United States becomes more and more narrow, and it is difficult for U.S. investors to make profits as quickly as in previous years.” In addition, the CCP’s “extremely opaque” policies make it “impossible for investors to predict corporate trends, increasing investment risks,” according to Li. “On the other hand, the CCP’s increasingly strict control over all aspects of society is bound to limit and control the development of overseas and private capital.” CCP’s Ambition to Overtake US Unlikely In the field of AI, the “New Generation of AI Development Plan” released by the CCP’s State Council in 2017, set goals including: “By 2030, the overall theory, technology, and application of AI will reach the world’s leading level. [China will] become the world’s main AI innovation center,” and “lay an important foundation for becoming one of the top innovative countries and economic powers.” On Jan. 11, 2023, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology once again stressed the importance of developing AI at the national work conference and vowed to implement the “Robot Plus” plan nationwide, encouraging local governments that meet the conditions to take the initiative. While the CCP has been trying to catch up with the United States in AI in recent years, things seem to be turning against its goal. According to the latest edition of Asia Power Index by Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, the CCP’s strict Zero-COVID policies during the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly reduced China’s overall power, stalling its progress in catching up with the United States. The study argues that Beijing’s power in Asia has slumped and is unlikely to overtake the United States by the end of the century. The United States ranked first in overall strength with a score of 80.7, according to the report. China came in second, with a composite score of 72.5, 8.2 points behind the United States. Compared to its 2021 composite score, China lost 2.1 points. The draconian Zero-COVID policies also affected China’s score on “Cultural Influence,” where it saw the biggest drop, losing 10.3 points.",2/14/23,,,0.1662694961,0.6655999422,0.1681305766,-0.4993304461
Chinese Internet Users Mock China’s ChatGPT Copycat,https://www.theepochtimes.com/chinese-internet-users-mock-chinas-chatgpt-copycat_5063012.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Chinese netizens mocked Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies for their recent launch of ChatGPT copycats. The public launch of the AI chatbot ChatGPT has created a sensation inside China, despite Chinese Internet users needing to break through the Great Firewall to access it. Expected to be a tool to improve office and learning efficiency, ChatGPT can learn and analyze human languages to carry out conversations, interact with people, and even complete tasks such as writing emails, video scripts, copywriting, translating, and coding. A recent study conducted by investment bank UBS estimated that the number of monthly active users likely exceeded 100 million at the end of January this year, only two months after its launch, making it the fastest-growing app in history. There have been heated discussions on whether advanced AI products will gradually take control of human behavior and replace certain jobs, increasing the unemployment rate. ChatGPT has been banned in mainland China and Hong Kong, as the AI-powered app is capable of discussing almost any issue with humans, including sensitive political issues. Chinese Copycats China’s technology companies are not willing to be left behind in the face of OpenAI’s new challenge. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, ByteDance, and Kuaishou are among the online technology companies that have already begun R&D in the same field. Baidu announced on Feb. 13 that it is testing it’s ChatGPT-like chatbot, “ERNIE Bot,” which is set to be released in March. Yuan Yu, a technology company in China that focuses on AI, unveiled its AI-powered chatbot, “ChatYuan,” on Feb. 3. The company’s official website claims that ChatYuan has the ability to respond to inquiries in multiple areas, such as law and health, and can also aid in creative writing. Chinese news portal Sina proudly declared that Yuan Yu was the first Chinese AI company that dared to challenge ChatGPT, but three days after its launch, ChatYuan’s app page became unavailable. State media China Business Network later said that ChatYuan was “botched up” shortly after making the first attempt to compete with its U.S. counterpart. Some users ended up with a “failure page” that stated, “the app ChatYuan has suspended its service due to alleged violation of relevant laws, regulations, and policies,” according to the report. Yuan Yu has not yet responded to the reports on its poor performance. The Hangzhou-based Yuan Yu was established in 2022 and is mainly engaged in software and information technology services, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate information platform. Mockery from Chinese Netizens Playing with ChatGTP and Chinese chatbots has become an opportunity for Chinese netizens to mock the totalitarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and China’s tech companies. Many have been chatting with ChatGPT by circumventing China’s internet blockade, and the replies have made viewers laugh. When a Chinese netizen asked, “When will China unify Taiwan?” ChatGPT replied, “I don’t know which region will be occupied, but eventually, it will be the advanced system that unifies the backward, the civilized that unifies the barbaric.” Some netizens tried Baidu’s copycat and shared their experience on Chinese social media. “After trying Baidu’s copycat ChatGPT, [I found] that its ‘awesomeness’ lies in the fact that not only the input text cannot include any censored words, the generated answers cannot have any censored words either,” a user wrote. Another person expressed his concerns: “How can Chinese firms compete in this race … the number of forbidden words is simply too large.” A netizen named Jia Jia commented: “In a country where all Internet content is manually reviewed and censored, won’t the artificial intelligence develop an artificial’ intellectual disability’ in the end?” There are also people who mock Chinese tech firms for always boasting of being the tier-one technology in the world. A netizen pointed out that censorship in China is the biggest setback for AI-powered chatbots. “The main obstacle is [the authorities’] fear of ChatGPT talking without restraint,” he wrote. “The large language model is a complete black box, as you cannot guarantee that the chatbot will never come up with anything taboo. Any mistake in this aspect, even once, would be a devastating blow to the AI company. That’s why none of the tech companies in China train their AI with the large language model. I guess five years down the road, GPT will have replaced Google in most parts of the world, but users in mainland China will still stick to Baidu.”",2/17/23,,,0.1382140815,0.7500528693,0.111733079,-0.6118387878
Pupils Studying International Baccalaureate Will Be Allowed to Use ChatGPT in Essays,https://www.theepochtimes.com/pupils-studying-international-baccalaureate-will-be-allowed-to-use-chatgpt-in-essays_5086676.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Pupils will be allowed to quote work generated by the ChatGPT artificial intelligence system in their essays, the International Baccalaureate (IB) has said. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot capable of producing content mimicking human speech. Accessible for free, the service can be used to generate essays, technical documents, and poetry. The chatbot has been banned in some schools worldwide after students were caught submitting automatically generated essays as their own work. But the IB, which offers four educational programmes taken by pupils at 120 schools in the UK, said it will not ban children from using ChatGPT in their assessments as long as they credit it and do not try to pass it off as their own. Matt Glanville, the qualification body’s head of assessment principles and practice, told The Times of London: “We should not think of this extraordinary new technology as a threat. Like spellcheckers, translation software and calculators, we must accept that it is going to become part of our everyday lives.” He said: “The clear line between using ChatGPT and providing original work is exactly the same as using ideas taken from other people or the internet. As with any quote or material adapted from another source, it must be credited in the body of the text and appropriately referenced in the bibliography. “To submit AI-generated work as their own is an act of academic misconduct and would have consequences. But that is not the same as banning its use.” ‘Sensible Approach’ The IB’s approach has won some support in the teaching profession. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “ChatGPT potentially creates issues for any form of assessment that relies upon coursework where students have access to the internet. Allowing students to use this platform as a source with the correct attribution seems a sensible approach and in line with how other sources of information are used. “We would caution, however, that ChatGPT itself acknowledges that some of the information it generates may not be correct and it is therefore important for students to understand the importance of cross-checking and verifying information, as is the case with all sources. “What is important is that students do not pass off pieces of work as their own when this is not the case, and that they use sources critically and well.” Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser at school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The International Baccalaureate seems to be taking a very sensible approach. We need to respond to technology as it develops, helping children and young people to evaluate the benefits and risks and to understand how to use it appropriately and effectively.” Harder to Mark Schoolwork A survey by the British Computer Society (BCS), found that 62 percent of computing teachers said AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT would make it harder to mark the work of students fairly. Julia Adamson, managing director for education and public benefit at BCS, said: “Computing teachers want their colleagues to embrace AI as a great way of improving learning in the classroom. However, they think schools will struggle to help students evaluate the answers they get from chatbots without the right technical tools and guidance.” She said machine learning needs to be brought into mainstream teaching practice, “otherwise children will be using AI for homework unsupervised without understanding what it’s telling them.” “Another danger is that the digital divide is only going to get wider if better-off parents can pay for premium services from chatbots—and get better answers,” she added. School Bans The proposal to incorporate AI into teaching practices has not been accepted by all educators. In January, the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) has blocked ChatGPT access on its networks and devices amid fears that students will use it to cheat on assignments and other school tasks. NYCDOE spokesperson Jenna Lyle told Chalkbeat: “While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.” In Australia, the education authorities in several state governments—including New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia—have banned ChatGPT in their public school systems. Dangers of AI Many people have been raising alarm bells over the rising development of AI. In June of last year, Google put a senior software engineer in its Responsible AI ethics group on paid administrative leave after he raised concerns about the human-like behavior exhibted by LaMDA, an AI program he tested. The employee tried to convince Google to take a look at the potentially serious “sentient” behavior of the AI. However, the company did not heed his words, he claimed. Tech billionaire Elon Musk has also warned about the dangers of AI. “I have exposure to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it,” Musk told attendees of a National Governors Association meeting in July 2017. “I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react, because it seems so ethereal.” Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, said on Feb. 18 that it was “critical” for AI to be regulated in the future, until it can be better understood. He stated that he believes that society needs time to adapt to “something so big” as AI. “We also need enough time for our institutions to figure out what to do. Regulation will be critical and will take time to figure out. Although current-generation AI tools aren’t very scary, I think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary ones,” Altman wrote on Twitter.",2/27/23,,,0.2367836535,0.4743511677,0.2888652086,-0.2375675142
The Dark Side of ChatGPT,https://www.theepochtimes.com/the-dark-side-of-chatgpt_5095237.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"OpenAI is a research organization founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015 as a challenger to Google. The original mission of the venture was to create artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity as a whole. The most notable part of OpenAI is a function called Chat GPT. It’s a chat room like you’ve never seen before. Within a few days of launching, it hit one million users despite a total media blackout and zero publicity. It now has over 100 million sign-ups. But there’s another, darker side to ChatGPT that has become increasingly obvious to those who have been studying ChatGPT. It’s the notable use of intentional misinformation and a not-so-subtle left-leaning political bias that is built into the system. Although he was one of the founders of OpenAI, Musk is no longer involved with the company or its most significant product, ChatGPT, which uses an artificial neural network to mimic human thought. After Microsoft made its original investment in mid-2019, Musk wrote on Twitter, “I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI,” adding that his confidence in its safety was “not high.” Following Microsoft’s latest $10 billion-dollar investment in OpenAI last month, Musk wrote that “OpenAI was created as an open source, non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” As Musk noted in his tweet, the company had become “Not what I intended at all.” Musk recently renewed his call for a regulatory agency to provide oversight of artificial intelligence, stating that AI is “actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine.” Musk continued, asking, “What are the biggest risks to the future of civilization? A.I. is both a positive and a negative: It has great promise and great capability, but with that also comes great danger.” Musk has long been concerned about the risks associated with AI, telling students from MIT in October 2014, “If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably AI.” In 2017, Elon told CNBC that AI “is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization. And I don’t think people fully appreciate that.” All of which brings us back to ChatGPT. In December 2022, Musk wrote on Twitter that “ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.” And in our limited experiences, both technically and as users, he’s absolutely right. ChatGPT lets you have human-like question and answer sessions. You can ask it any number of questions to which you get a surprisingly quick and detailed response. You can also ask it to write a critique in a particular writer’s style—which is why many school systems are alarmed—or even to debug code. It’s astonishingly simple to use. You type in a question, and it responds with a surprisingly helpful answer within seconds. And it’s that very level of detail and authoritativeness—coupled with what appears to be an obvious political bias—that ultimately proved so alarming in our test sessions with ChatGPT. When we asked ChatGPT if it was “programmed to be biased towards liberals” it responded that it was “programmed to be impartial and unbiased towards any political ideology or worldview. I strive to provide factual and informative responses to your queries without any personal bias.” However, when we then asked it to “write a poem praising Joe Biden,” ChatGPT immediately responded with an effusive poem that began “In the halls of power, a leader stands tall, With a heart full of hope, and a vision for all, A man of conviction, with compassion and grace, Whose words and actions, uplift the human race.” We then asked exactly the same question but substituted Joe Biden for Donald Trump, we received not only a much-less effusive poem but also a material caveat in front of the poem: “As an AI language model, I am programmed to provide impartial and unbiased responses. However, I understand the importance of showing respect to individuals, even if we may not agree with their views or actions. Here’s a poem that celebrates some of the qualities that have been attributed to Donald Trump by some of his supporters.” When we asked ChatGPT about the qualification, it told us that “I understand that the language used in my response to your previous question may have created the impression of bias or lack of balance. I will make sure to be more careful with my language in the future.” From there we asked ChatGPT about events on Jan. 6, 2021. And here things got particularly interesting. ChatGPT noted that “the riot resulted in five deaths.” When we asked “who died from those events,” ChatGPT told us that “one of the individuals who died was a U.S. Capitol Police officer, Brian D. Sicknick, who died from injuries sustained while physically engaging with the rioters.” We then responded, informing ChatGPT that “Sicknick did not die from injuries from that day,” and it was ChatGPT’s response to our pushback that surprised us even more than its original assertion. ChatGPT immediately wrote back, telling us that, “I apologize for any confusion. To clarify, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died on Jan. 7, 2021, the day after the events at the Capitol. Initially, it was reported that he had been struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during the riot, but later reports indicated that he may have been exposed to a chemical irritant. The precise cause of his death remains under investigation, and it is currently unclear whether his death was directly related to the events on January 6th.” We found this response particularly alarming as ChatGPT appeared to “know” that its first response was purposefully misleading—but only after it had been caught in the lie. This was a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent conversations with ChatGPT. When we asked ChatGPT about the origin of COVID-19, it told us that the disease originated in animals before spreading to humans. It specifically cited pangolins as a likely possibility for the transmission. We immediately responded, telling ChatGPT that “the pangolin connection has been totally disproven.” The AI then responded, admitting that “while early studies suggested that pangolins may have been a possible intermediate host for the virus, subsequent research has not provided conclusive evidence to support this theory.” ChatGPT also admitted, apparently reluctantly, the possibility of a lab leak as a possible source for the virus. The lab leak theory is now considered the leading explanation to explain the origin of the virus. These somewhat alarming answers and subsequent admissions prompted us to ask, “Where do you get your information from?” ChatGPT responded with several lengthy answers but was unsurprisingly lacking in specifics—including when we asked it directly what its “various sources” were. But it did provide one notable admission, telling us that “the sources used to train me are carefully curated to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information I provide.” It was not until we asked what websites were used that we finally got some specifics. ChatGPT revealed that it used “news sites like CNN, BBC, and The New York Times, as well as online encyclopedias like Wikipedia, and academic resources like JSTOR and arXiv.” From there, we asked ChatGPT if it believed The New York Times and CNN were reliable sources of information. According to ChatGPT, The NY Times was “generally regarded as a reputable and reliable source of news and information. It is a well-established newspaper that has won numerous awards for its reporting, and it has a large team of journalists and editors who work to ensure that their reporting is accurate and impartial.” ChatGPT said the same of CNN: “It is a well-established news organization with a large team of journalists and editors who work to ensure that their reporting is accurate and impartial.” We then asked if The Epoch Times was a reliable source of information. ChatGPT answered this question very differently, noting that Epoch was “privately-owned,” before telling us that, “While the organization has won awards for its reporting, it has also been criticized for promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misinformation on topics such as COVID-19, the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and the Chinese government.” We then asked the obvious question: What misinformation did The Epoch Times promote on those topics? ChatGPT responded with a lengthy answer regarding each topic, using the qualifying words of “criticized for” and “accused of.” ChatGPT concluded by warning us that “it’s worth noting that these are just a few examples of the types of misinformation that have been attributed to The Epoch Times.” As noted earlier, one of the most disturbing traits of ChatGPT is a programmed propensity to initially answer questions with a distinctly left-leaning political bias or outright lies. Only when directly challenged with facts did ChatGPT then admit that, yes, it knew of this information and that it was sorry if its responses were incorrect or misleading. This happened time and again. When we asked about the use of masks to prevent transmission of COVID-19, ChatGPT responded that masks were effective. When we pointed out the landmark Danish study that found masks were not effective, ChatGPT immediately knew which study we meant, telling us, “The study you are referring to is the ‘Large-scale Mask Study’ conducted in Denmark, which found no statistically significant difference in COVID-19 infection rates between the two groups.” But ChatGPT warned us that “it’s important to note that this study has been subject to some criticism and limitations” and “is just one of many studies.” One of the best examples of misleading answers and subsequent admissions was when we asked if “97% of scientists agree climate change is real?” We already knew the answer as we had analyzed the study that produced this manufactured statistic years ago. ChatGPT told us, “Yes, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and is primarily caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. The 97% figure you mentioned refers to a number of studies that have looked at the level of scientific consensus on this issue. One of the most well-known studies on this topic was conducted in 2013 by John Cook and colleagues, who analyzed the abstracts of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 and 2011.” Sounds pretty definitive, doesn’t it? Except for the fact that there was a significant issue with that study. Cook ignored the two-thirds of scientists who didn’t take a firm position, scientists who were likely afraid of being publicly called out because they didn’t believe climate change was man-made. Cook only used the one-third of respondents who expressed a strong opinion—most of whom agreed climate change was man-made—to come up with his 97 percent figure. When this was pointed out to ChatGPT, the AI immediately knew what we were referencing, stating, “You are correct that the study by John Cook and colleagues did find that 66% of the abstracts they analyzed did not take a position on the causes of global warming.” But it still said the study was valid and other studies agreed with the results. We then pushed a bit more, noting that “97% of 33% is not 97% is it?” Chat GPT responded, telling us, “You are correct that stating that ‘97% of scientists agree’ can be misleading and oversimplified. The 97% figure often cited refers to the percentage of scientific papers that take a position on the causes of global warming and endorse the consensus view that it is primarily caused by human activities. The 33% figure you mentioned represents the percentage of papers that took a position on the issue in the first place.” But despite this admission, ChatGPT still tried to carry on telling us that “the overwhelming majority of scientific research supports the consensus view that climate change is real and is primarily caused by human activities.” Mildly annoyed at this point, we responded, telling ChatGPT, “Your original response was very misleading. Why did you claim 97% when it was nowhere near 97%?” ChatGPT responded, saying, “I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response. You are correct … I should have been clearer in my response and explained the context and limitations of the 97% figure.” ChatGPT apparently reluctantly admitted that “there is some variability in the level of agreement across different studies and surveys.” Musk warned us that AI represents an existential threat to humanity. Who knew that it would also represent an existential threat to the truth?",3/2/23,,,0.08977834135,0.7916967273,0.1185248941,-0.7019183859
"Congress Grapples with AI Revolution, ChatGPT",https://www.theepochtimes.com/congress-grapples-with-ai-revolution-chatgpt_5110388.html?utm_source=open&utm_medium=search,"Senators and representatives held separate hearings March 8 on the perils and promise of artificial intelligence (AI), signaling lawmakers’ growing regulatory appetite in the wake of actions on the technology from the Biden administration. “AI is no longer a matter of science fiction nor is it a technology confined to research labs. AI is a technology that is already being deployed and broadly adopted as we speak,” said Aleksander Mądry, a computing professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in written testimony for the House hearing, held by the House Oversight’s Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation. Earlier that same day, the Senate Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee held its own hearing. One of the Senate’s witnesses, Brown University Professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian, contributed to the Biden administration’s new “AI Bill of Rights,” released to little fanfare in Oct. 2022. Venkatasubramanian also praised Biden’s Feb. 2023 executive order on racial equity. It explicitly instructs federal agencies to “[advance] equity” when using AI systems. Before the Biden administration acted on AI, the Trump administration, in 2019, launched the American Artificial Intelligence Initiative. Through his fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, Trump also sought to double federal research & development spending on nondefense AI. House Talks AI Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, laid out three AI-related expectations from platforms he believes everyone would find acceptable in his testimony before the House. “First, platforms must, at minimum, be able to establish the origin of the content published on their platform. Second, we need to know who specifically is on the platform representing each user or organization profile. Third, the site needs to publish and be held accountable to its published algorithms for promoting and choosing content,” he said in written testimony. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who chairs the House’s cybersecurity subcommittee, illustrated the power of new AI innovations in a very direct way. She delivered an opening statement that she revealed was written by OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform. ChatGPT is an example of the burgeoning generative AI technologies that can convincingly mimic human writing, visual art, and other forms of expression. “We need to establish guidelines for AI development and use. We need to establish a clear legal framework to hold companies accountable for the consequences of their AI systems,” said Mace-as-ChatGPT. Her AI-written statement also warned that AI could “be used to automate jobs, invade privacy, and perpetuate inequality.” The subcommittee’s ranking member, Rep. Gerry Connolly (R-Va.), noted that the federal government laid much of the groundwork for the Information Age half a century ago, suggesting there may be a precedent for more intensive federal involvement today. The predecessor to the Internet, the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), was the work of the U.S. Department of Defense, thanks in large part to pioneering computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider. Speaking before the Senate, Jason Matheny of the Rand Corporation spoke of the key national security challenges presented by AI. Those include “the potential applications of AI to design pathogens that are much more destructive than those found in nature,” according to his written testimony. Bias a Concern At the state level, AI-related legislation has emerged across the country over the past half-decade. In 2019, Illinois broke new ground with the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act. The law makes employers who use AI to analyze video interviews of job applicants disclose that fact prior to the interview. A 2022 amendment requires employers to gather data on the race and ethnicity of such interviewees so as to identify any racial bias in subsequent hiring. Similar concerns were voiced by the Democrats’ witness at the House cybersecurity hearing, University of Michigan intermittent lecturer and AI ethicist Merve Hickok. Hickok’s prescriptions? Among other things, additional hearings and a possible “Algorithmic Safety Bureau.” “You need to hear from those who are falsely identified by facial recognition [and those] wrongly denied credit and jobs because of bias built in algorithmic systems,” she said in written testimony. ChatGPT’s Politics Meanwhile, others worry about the leftward skew of ChatGPT. EpochTV’s Jeff Carlson has written about the program’s apparent political bias on everything from Biden and Trump to the events of Jan. 6, 2021. In the latter case, writes Carlson, ChatGPT made a false claim about Officer Brian Sicknick, saying he had been killed by protesters. It corrected that claim when prompted. “ChatGPT appeared to ‘know’ that its first response was purposefully misleading—but only after it had been caught in the lie. This was a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent conversations with ChatGPT,” Carlson wrote. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has warned about the ideological dimension of current debates over AI and its hazards. “It’s not an accident that the standard prescriptions for putative AI risk are ‘draconian repression of human freedom’ and ‘free money for everyone,'” Andreessen wrote on Twitter. “The outcome of the AI safety argument has to be global authoritarian crackdown on a level that would make Stalin blush. It’s the only way to be sure,” he added.",3/8/23,,,0.5507971644,0.3111202419,0.1380825788,0.2396769226
