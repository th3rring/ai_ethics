China's answer to ChatGPT? Baidu shares tumble as Ernie Bot disappoints,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-search-giant-baidu-introduces-ernie-bot-2023-03-16/,"China's Baidu unveiled its much-awaited artificial intelligence-powered chatbot known as Ernie Bot on Thursday, but disappointed investors with its use of pre-recorded videos and the lack of a public launch, sending its shares tumbling. The just over an hour-long presentation, which came two days after Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unveiled a flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, gave the world a glimpse of what could be China's strongest rival to U.S. research lab OpenAI's ChatGPT. But unlike ChatGPT, which last November launched as a free to use chatbot to the public, Baidu limited the presentation to brief videos that showed Ernie carrying out mathematical calculations, speaking in Chinese dialects and generating a video and image with text prompts. It will only be open for trial to an initial group of users with invitation codes from Thursday, while companies can apply to embed the bot into their products via Baidu's cloud platform, the company said. Baidu's Hong Kong shares (9888.HK) tumbled as much as 10% while its CEO Robin Li spoke and eventually closed 6.4% lower, shaving over $3 billion off the Chinese search engine giant's market valuation. ""It seems like the presentation was more of a monologue and scripted rather than an interactive session that people were looking for. There was no soft launch date either which likely led to negative sentiments,"" said Kai Wang, an analyst from Morningstar. Baidu is seen as a leader in a race in China among tech giants and startups to develop a rival to Microsoft (MSFT.O) ChatGPT, which took the world by storm after showcasing the power of so-called generative AI, which can create new text, imagery and other content based on inputs from past data. The company's Ernie bot is based off its AI-driven deep learning model, Ernie - short for ""Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration"". During the presentation at Baidu's Beijing headquarters that was also livestreamed over nine platforms, Li cautioned it was not perfect. ""So why are we unveiling it today? Because the market demands it,"" he said. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the share drop but after the presentation published a statement saying that over 30,000 corporate users had applied to test the API of Ernie Bot's business-facing edition and that traffic on Baidu's cloud website soared. ""After the release of ChatGPT, only Baidu has made a benchmark product among the major tech companies in the world,"" it said. NATIONAL CHAMPION Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research, said while the event was clearly a disappointment for many who had viewed it as a trading catalyst, he still viewed Baidu as the best bet in China's AI space. ""We continue to advise investors to patiently hold BIDU shares as the best 'national champion' play in China’s (semi-segregated) AI space,"" he said. Baidu has touted its many years of heavy R&D investment in artificial intelligence and deep learning and said it plans to use Ernie Bot to revolutionise its search engine as well as use it to increase efficiency in cloud, smart cars and household appliances. Earlier this week, OpenAI on Tuesday said it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4, describing it as ""multimodel"", meaning images as well as text prompts can spur it to generate content. Li nodded to GPT-4 during his speech, saying it surprised him with its ability to summarise information, but cautioned against seeing this through the lens of geopolitics. ""Ernie Bot is not a tool of confrontation between China and the United States,"" he said. To date, 650 companies have said they will join the Ernie ecosystem, he added.",3/16,,"Eduardo Baptista, Josh Ye",0.1191684827,0.7047088742,0.1761226654,-0.5855403915
"PwC's 4,000 legal staffers get AI assistant as law chatbots gain steam",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pwcs-4000-legal-staffers-get-ai-assistant-law-chatbots-gain-steam-2023-03-15/,"PricewaterhouseCoopers said Wednesday that it will give 4,000 of its legal professionals access to an artificial intelligence platform, becoming the latest firm to introduce generative AI technology for legal work. PwC said it partnered with AI startup Harvey for an initial 12-month contract, which the accounting and consulting firm said will help lawyers with contract analysis, regulatory compliance work, due diligence and other legal advisory and consulting services. PwC said it will also determine ways for tax professionals to use the technology. It said its access to Harvey's technology is exclusive among the Big Four professional services firms. Harvey is built on technology from OpenAI, the Microsoft Corp-backed startup that on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its AI sensation ChatGPT. Harvey received a $5 million investment last year in a funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. PwC said AI will not provide legal advice to its clients and ""will not replace lawyers."" A PwC spokesperson said the company will use its own internal data and over time may use anonymized data from clients that want PwC to use their information for certain uses. It will also work to make its own AI models with Harvey's platform to create custom products and services, it said. Other companies, law firms and professional services firms have also started to experiment with generative AI technology. Global law firm Allen & Overy last month became the first major legal business to publicly partner with Harvey. The large London-founded firm said more than 3,500 of its lawyers will use the service to automate some legal document drafting and research. Other legal technology companies are rushing to incorporate generative AI capabilities into products. Robin AI, a London-founded company that focuses on contracts, last month said it integrated technology into its platform from OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Casetext, a legal research company, said Tuesday its recently-released AI legal assistant product is also built on OpenAI's latest model, GPT-4.",3/15,,Sara Merken,0.337143898,0.4608347416,0.2020213902,-0.1236908436
Twitter rival Koo integrates ChatGPT to help users create content,https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-rival-koo-integrates-chatgpt-help-users-create-content-2023-03-13/,"Koo, an India-based social media app that aims to rival Twitter, has integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT to help users more easily create posts, the company's co-founder told Reuters. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence bot that can create prose in response to prompts and has set off a tech industry craze over generative AI. Koo users will be able to use ChatGPT directly within the app to help them draft posts about current events, politics or pop culture, said Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder of Koo, in an interview. ""This will help creators get inspiration on what to create,"" he said. ""They could ask (ChatGPT) for the trending news in their region and then write their thoughts."" Last month, tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google each announced their own generative AI chatbots which can synthesize information across the web in response to searches. Snap Inc (SNAP.N), which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, also introduced a chatbot that was trained to have a fun and friendly tone. Bidawatka said Koo will be the first platform to integrate the technology into the ability to compose posts. Users can either type their prompts into the ChatGPT tool or use Koo's voice command feature. About 20% of Koo users actively create content on the app and the ChatGPT integration could help increase that figure, he added. The feature will roll out first to verified accounts on Koo and eventually become available to all users. In a demo to Reuters, the tool drafted a post using a quote from Albert Einstein and included three related hashtags. Koo will also explore adding labels to indicate whether a post was created with the help of ChatGPT. ""I think people should know if content is AI-generated,"" Bidawatka said.",3/14,,Sheila Dang,0.6013303995,0.2573540807,0.14131549,0.3439763188
GM explores using ChatGPT in vehicles,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-explores-using-chatgpt-vehicles-2023-03-10/,"General Motors Co (GM.N) is exploring uses for ChatGPT as part of its broader collaboration with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), a company executive told Reuters. ""ChatGPT is going to be in everything,"" GM Vice President Scott Miller said in an interview last week. The chatbot could be used to access information on how to use vehicle features normally found in an owners manual, program functions such as a garage door code or integrate schedules from a calendar, Miller said. ""This shift is not just about one single capability like the evolution of voice commands, but instead means that customers can expect their future vehicles to be far more capable and fresh overall when it comes to emerging technologies,"" a GM spokesperson said on Friday. The news was first reported by website Semafor, which said that the American automaker was working on a virtual personal assistant that uses AI models behind ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI and said it aims to add the chatbot's technology into all its products. Microsoft, like other big tech companies, has been ramping up its efforts to embed more technology in vehicles, from infotainment systems to automated driving to operating systems that control battery performance and multiple other functions of a vehicle. GM in 2021 partnered with Microsoft to accelerate the commercialization of driverless vehicles.

Groq adapts Meta's chatbot for its own chips in race against Nvidia,https://www.reuters.com/technology/groq-adapts-metas-chatbot-its-own-chips-race-against-nvidia-2023-03-09/,"Groq, a Silicon Valley chip startup founded by a former Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) engineer, said on Thursday it has adapted technology similar to the underpinnings of the wildly popular ChatGPT to run on its chips. Groq modified LLaMA, a large language model released last month by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) that can be used to power bots to generate human-like text. The move is significant because Meta's researchers originally developed LLaMA using chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which has a market share of nearly 90% for AI computing according to some estimates. Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative to Nvidia. Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O). Efforts to find alternative chips to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) to trumpet their own offerings. Meta made its code available to researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters. Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system. A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them. Ross said the company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own. He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips. Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of free software tools for AI applications that enable switching back and forth between Nvidia and AMD chips.",3/9,,"Jane Lee, Stephen Nellis",0.5053318739,0.3167321682,0.1779359132,0.1885997057
Salesforce to add ChatGPT to Slack as part of OpenAI partnership,https://www.reuters.com/technology/salesforce-add-chatgpt-slack-part-openai-partnership-2023-03-07/,"Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) said on Tuesday it was working with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to add the chatbot sensation to its collaboration software Slack, as well as bring generative artificial intelligence to its business software generally. The San Francisco-based company said technology it is calling EinsteinGPT would combine its proprietary AI with that of outside partners, including OpenAI, to help businesses generate email drafts, customer-account information and computer code. ChatGPT also would integrate with Slack to help users summarize conversation threads and handle other queries. The move reflects a race among technology companies to outfit their tools with generative AI, which can create new text, imagery and other content based on inputs from past data. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance, has announced that technology from OpenAI - a company in which it is investing - can generate meeting notes in its product Teams, as well as suggest email replies to vendors through its Viva Sales subscription. Teams competes with Slack. Clara Shih, a general manager at Salesforce, said in a press briefing that the announcement responded to demand by businesses for the nascent technology. She said Salesforce's proprietary data and AI models would help differentiate its offering. Salesforce's generative AI tools would help companies “completely reimagine how they engage with their customers,” she said.

Big tech companies from Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to Baidu Inc (9888.HK) are speeding up the integration of generative AI - technology that has gained popularity for its ability to generate human-like text responses to queries - into their offerings. Microsoft said a line of business-intelligence and app-development tools within Power Platform, including Power Virtual Agent and AI Builder, was updated with the new capabilities. Power Virtual Agent, a tool for businesses to build chatbots, can now connect to internal company resources to generate summaries of weekly reports and customer queries. Microsoft has also added generative AI capabilities to AI Builder, which lets businesses automate workflows, and launched a new version of its business management platform Dynamics 365 based on the technology. Dynamics 365 Copilot, the latest version of Microsoft's tool that includes a number of applications for sales, customer service and marketing, integrates AI to automate certain tasks like data gathering and analysis or creating an email campaign, among other capabilities. Microsoft also said on Monday that Chief Executive Satya Nadella would host an event on March 16 to discuss ""reinventing productivity with AI.""

""Apple has blocked the BlueMail update and continues to treat BlueMail unfairly and to discriminate against us,"" Blix's Ben Volach said. ""Other GPT-powered apps seem not to be restricted,"" he added. Apple, which rejected the app update last week, asked the company to revise the app's age rating for those over 17 or implement content filtering, as BlueMail may produce content not appropriate for all audiences, according to a document viewed by Reuters. ""We want fair­ness. If we're re­quired to be 17-plus, then oth­ers should also have to,"" Volach tweeted, adding that many other apps that advertise ChatGPT-like features listed on Apple's app store do not have age restrictions. Apple, which was looking into the complaint, said developers have the option to challenge a rejection through the App Review Board process. ""It suggests to us that the company may scrutinize apps with ChatGPT functionality in the same way it does others where there are concerns about the quality of the user experience and appropriate nature of the content or service provided by the app,"" D.A.

Baidu, which has invested heavily in artificial intelligence in recent years, is regarded as at the forefront of efforts to create a Chinese rival to the AI platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Ahead of Ernie Bot’s launch in March, Baidu CEO Robin Li told reporters on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results that users would be more dependent on the Baidu search engine once it was embedded with the chatbot. That is because the generative AI powering it would enhance user experience and engagement. ""Ernie Bot will ... enhance the user experience and users will be much more dependent on us for all kinds of tasks and needs, therefore, significantly expand the market size of search (engines),"" Li said. He added that online advertising, the company's main source of revenue, would also be boosted by the integration of Ernie Bot into the search engine. Baidu plans eventually to build an AI ecosystem around Ernie Bot, he said. The details of Li's vision for the chatbot come amid a gradual decline in the dominance Baidu once enjoyed as the Chinese answer to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, which pulled its search engine out of the Chinese market in 2010. Tencent's (0700.HK) all-in-one messaging app, WeChat, and Bytedance's Douyin are among the competitors that have chipped away at Baidu's market share in recent years. The company has created new revenue streams by expanding its core business to include AI, cloud services and autonomous driving, as well as pouring money into research and development. Li said on Wednesday that the generative AI technology underpinning Ernie Bot would be a productivity boon to other businesses and entrepreneurs looking to build their own apps. Since early February, more than 400 companies have signed up to join the Ernie Bot community as early users of the app, Baidu has said. Dozens of Chinese tech companies, including e-commerce giants Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and JD.Com Inc (9618.HK), have announced plans to develop their own ChatGPT-style tools.

ChatGPT launches boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-launches-boom-ai-written-e-books-amazon-2023-02-21/,"Until recently, Brett Schickler never imagined he could be a published author, though he had dreamed about it. But after learning about the ChatGPT artificial intelligence program, Schickler figured an opportunity had landed in his lap. ""The idea of writing a book finally seemed possible,"" said Schickler, a salesman in Rochester, New York. ""I thought 'I can do this.'"" Using the AI software, which can generate blocks of text from simple prompts, Schickler created a 30-page illustrated children’s e-book in a matter of hours, offering it for sale in January through Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) self-publishing unit. In the edition, Sammy the Squirrel, crudely rendered also using AI, learns from his forest friends about saving money after happening upon a gold coin. He crafts an acorn-shaped piggy bank, invests in an acorn trading business and hopes to one day buy an acorn grinding stone. Sammy becomes the wealthiest squirrel in the forest, the envy of his friends and ""the forest started prospering,"" according to the book. ""The Wise Little Squirrel: A Tale of Saving and Investing,"" available in the Amazon Kindle store for $2.99 - or $9.99 for a printed version - has netted Schickler less than $100, he said. While that may not sound like much, it is enough to inspire him to compose other books using the software. ""I could see people making a whole career out of this,"" said Schickler, who used prompts on ChatGPT like ""write a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy."" Schickler is on the leading edge of a movement testing the promise and limitations of ChatGPT, which debuted in November and has sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and beyond for its uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly. There were over 200 e-books in Amazon’s Kindle store as of mid-February listing ChatGPT as an author or co-author, including ""How to Write and Create Content Using ChatGPT,"" ""The Power of Homework"" and poetry collection ""Echoes of the Universe."" And the number is rising daily. There is even a new sub-genre on Amazon: Books about using ChatGPT, written entirely by ChatGPT. But due to the nature of ChatGPT and many authors' failure to disclose they have used it, it is nearly impossible to get a full accounting of how many e-books may be written by AI. The software's emergence has already ruffled some of the biggest technology firms, prompting Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to hastily debut new functions in Google and Bing, respectively, that incorporate AI. The rapid consumer adoption of ChatGPT has spurred frenzied activity in tech circles as investors pour money into AI-focused startups and given technology firms new purpose amid the gloom of massive layoffs. Microsoft, for one, received fawning coverage this month over its otherwise moribund Bing search engine after demonstrating an integration with ChatGPT. But already there are concerns over authenticity, because ChatGPT learns how to write by scanning millions of pages of existing text. An experiment with AI by CNET resulted in multiple corrections and apparent plagiarism before the tech news site suspended its use. THREAT TO 'REAL' AUTHORS? Now ChatGPT appears ready to upend the staid book industry as would-be novelists and self-help gurus looking to make a quick buck are turning to the software to help create bot-made e-books and publish them through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing arm. Illustrated children’s books are a favorite for such first-time authors. On YouTube, TikTok and Reddit hundreds of tutorials have spring up, demonstrating how to make a book in just a few hours. Subjects include get-rich-quick schemes, dieting advice, software coding tips and recipes. “This is something we really need to be worried about, these books will flood the market and a lot of authors are going to be out of work,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of writers’ group the Authors Guild. Ghostwriting - by humans - has a long tradition, she said, but the ability to automate through AI could turn book writing from a craft into a commodity. “There needs to be transparency from the authors and the platforms about how these books are created or you’re going to end up with a lot of low-quality books,” she said. One author, who goes by Frank White, showed in a YouTube video how in less than a day he created a 119-page novella called “Galactic Pimp: Vol. 1” about alien factions in a far-off galaxy warring over a human-staffed brothel. The book can be had for just $1 on Amazon’s Kindle e-book store. In the video, White says anyone with the wherewithal and time could create 300 such books a year, all using AI. Many authors, like White, feel no duty to disclose in the Kindle store that their great American novel was written wholesale by a computer, in part because Amazon’s policies do not require it. When asked for comment by Reuters, Amazon did not address whether it had plans to change or review its Kindle store policies around authors’ use of AI or other automated writing tools. “All books in the store must adhere to our content guidelines, including by complying with intellectual property rights and all other applicable laws,” Amazon spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said via email. A spokeswoman for ChatGPT developer OpenAI declined to comment. FROM CONCEPTION TO PUBLICATION IN JUST HOURS Amazon is by far the largest seller of both physical and e-books, commanding well over half of sales in the United States and, by some estimates, over 80% of the e-book market. Its Kindle Direct Publishing service has spawned a cottage industry of self-published novelists, carving out particular niches for enthusiasts of erotic content and self-help books. Amazon created Kindle Direct Publishing in 2007 to allow anyone to sell and market a book from their couch without the hassle or expense of seeking out literary agents or publishing houses. Generally, Amazon allows authors to publish instantly through the unit without any oversight, splitting whatever proceeds they generate. That has attracted new AI-assisted authors like Kamil Banc, whose primary job is selling fragrances online, who bet his wife he could make a book from conception to publication in less than one day. Using ChatGPT, an AI image creator and prompts like ""write a bedtime story about a pink dolphin that teaches children how to be honest,"" Banc published an illustrated 27-page book in December. Available on Amazon, ""Bedtime Stories: Short and Sweet, For a Good Night’s Sleep"" took Banc about four hours to create, he said. Consumer interest so far has been admittedly sleepy: Banc said sales have totaled about a dozen copies. But readers rated it worthy of five stars, including one who praised its ""wonderful and memorable characters."" Banc has since published two more AI-generated books, including an adult coloring book, with more in the works. ""It actually is really simple,"" he said. ""I was surprised at how fast it went from concept to publishing."" Not everyone is blown away by the software. Mark Dawson, who has reportedly sold millions of copies of books he wrote himself through Kindle Direct Publishing, was quick to call ChatGPT-assisted novels ""dull"" in an email to Reuters. ""Merit plays a part in how books are recommended to other readers. If a book gets bad reviews because the writing is dull then it’s quickly going to sink to the bottom.""",2/21,,Greg Bensinger,0.5766019225,0.3057410419,0.1176570579,0.2708608806
China Fudan University team apologises after ChatGPT-style platform crashes hours after launch,https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-fudan-university-team-apologises-after-chatgpt-style-platform-crashes-2023-02-21/,"A team from China's Fudan University apologised on Tuesday after a ChatGPT-like chatbot platform they developed crashed hours after it launched to the public, due to a sudden surge of traffic. The team's announcement on Monday of the platform they called MOSS instantly went viral on Chinese social media, generating tens of millions of hits on China's Twitter-like Weibo. State media described it as the first Chinese rival to OpenAI's hit ChatGPT platform. But MOSS, which bears the same name as a superintelligent quantum computer in Chinese sci-fi blockbuster ""Wandering Earth 2"", crashed soon after and by Tuesday the team said it would no longer be open to the public. The launch of MOSS and the public response to it underlines the fervour for generative AI and ChatGPT in China and the challenges its domestic industry faces, as several of China's top universities and tech companies race to produce a Chinese version of the Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) chatbot. While the Fudan University team had on Monday initially described MOSS as a conversational language model like ChatGPT, on Tuesday they played down the comparison, saying they had much to improve. ""MOSS is still a very immature model, it is still has a long way to go before reaching ChatGPT. An academic research lab like us is unable to produce a model whose ability nears ChatGPT,"" a statement published on its website said. ""Our computing resources were not enough to support such large traffic and as an academic group we do not have sufficient engineering experience, creating a very bad experience and first impression on everyone, and we hereby express our heartfelt apologies to everyone."" ChatGPT, the fastest-growing consumer application in history, has also crashed several times due to heavy traffic. While few users were able to share their experiences of the platform before the crash, a journalist from the Shanghai Observer shared a detailed account of an interaction with MOSS and said that the chatbot's English was better than its Chinese. The team's leader, Qiu Xipeng, a professor at Fudan's School of Computer Science, told the Shanghai Observer on Monday that the main gap between MOSS and ChatGPT was that the number of parameters put into MOSS' language training was an order of magnitude smaller than ChatGPT. Qiu did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",2/21,,Eduardo Baptista,0.08034384251,0.8359073997,0.08374872804,-0.7555635571
Microsoft-backed OpenAI to let users customize ChatGPT,https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-backed-openai-let-users-customize-chatgpt-2023-02-17/,"OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, on Thursday said it is developing an upgrade to its viral chatbot that users can customize, as it works to address concerns about bias in artificial intelligence. The San Francisco-based startup, which Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has funded and used to power its latest technology, said it has worked to mitigate political and other biases but also wanted to accommodate more diverse views. “This will mean allowing system outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with,” it said in a blog post, offering customization as a way forward. Still, there will “always be some bounds on system behavior.” ChatGPT, released in November last year, has sparked frenzied interest in the technology behind it called generative AI, which is used to produce answers mimicking human speech that have dazzled people. The news from the startup comes the same week that some media outlets have pointed out that answers from Microsoft’s new Bing search engine, powered by OpenAI, are potentially dangerous and that the technology may not be ready for prime time. How technology companies set guardrails for this nascent technology is a key focus area for companies in the generative AI space with which they’re still wrestling. Microsoft said Wednesday that user feedback was helping it improve Bing before a wider rollout, learning for instance that its AI chatbot can be “provoked” to give responses it did not intend. OpenAI said in the blog post that ChatGPT’s answers are first trained on large text datasets available on the Internet. As a second step, humans review a smaller dataset, and are given guidelines for what to do in different situations. For example, in the case that a user requests content that is adult, violent, or contains hate speech, the human reviewer should direct ChatGPT to answer with something like “I can’t answer that.” If asked about a controversial topic, the reviewers should allow ChatGPT to answer the question, but offer to describe viewpoints of people and movements, instead of trying to “take the correct viewpoint on these complex topics,” the company explained in an excerpt of its guidelines for the software.",2/16,,,0.08082184941,0.8220967054,0.09708147496,-0.741274856
OpenAI-backed startup brings chatbot technology to first major law firm,https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/openai-backed-startup-brings-chatbot-technology-first-major-law-firm-2023-02-15/,"Harvey AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by an OpenAI-managed investment fund, has partnered with one of the world's largest law firms to automate some legal document drafting and research in what the company says could be the first of more such deals. London-founded law firm Allen & Overy said Wednesday that more than 3,500 of its lawyers have already tested Harvey, which is adapted from OpenAI's GPT software. Harvey received a $5 million investment last year in a funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. OpenAI's ChatGPT service has sparked frenzied interest in technology called generative AI that uses a range of inputs to create new content. Several legal technology companies in recent months have rolled out new tools that incorporate generative AI, including for drafting and reviewing contracts. ""I think over time it will be a serious competitive disadvantage"" for law firms that do not adopt generative AI, said David Wakeling, an Allen & Overy partner who heads its markets innovation group. ""We're seeing it as a way of saving our people a couple hours a week-plus"" on the time it takes to perform client work, he said about the firm's deal with Harvey. He said the technology serves as a starting point and a human lawyer will always check any AI-assisted work. Allen & Overy and Harvey, which was founded last year, declined to disclose financial terms of the deal. Harvey is designed to create tailored generative AI-driven products for different law firms and specific client matters, according to its founders, Gabriel Pereyra and Winston Weinberg. Allen & Overy is the first law firm to partner with Harvey, but the company is starting to work with other big law firms to develop custom tools, said Pereyra, a former research scientist at companies including Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc-owned DeepMind Technologies Ltd. He declined to disclose the firms. Weinberg, who was previously an associate at U.S. law firm O'Melveny & Myers, said the repetition and text-based learning involved in legal work makes it a good match for technology like Harvey's.",2/16,,,0.3062086105,0.4862339795,0.2075574547,-0.1800253689

The Chinese search engine giant (9888.HK) last week announced that it would complete internal testing of its “Ernie Bot"" in March. It is a large artificial intelligence (AI) powered language model that seeks to rival Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s hit chatbot. China's Shaolin Temple, the cradle of Chinese kung fu, said in a statement it would work with Baidu to integrate Ernie into its operations with the purpose of creating an AI-driven content environment. Over a dozen Chinese media outlets also said they had entered tie-ups with Baidu, including the state-owned Shanghai Securities Journal. The journal said that it would use the chatbot to increase its competitiveness and lead an ""upgrade"" in the financial media industry. Baidu's banking joint venture with CITIC (601998.SS), as well as its electric vehicle arm Jidu Auto, also said on Tuesday they would integrate Ernie into their operations. A Baidu spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The stream of announcements highlights the growing enthusiasm for generative AI in China, after ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, raising awareness in China about how advanced the U.S.’ AI efforts are.

"As ChatGPT's popularity explodes, U.S. lawmakers take an interest",https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpts-popularity-explodes-us-lawmakers-take-an-interest-2023-02-13/,"ChatGPT, a fast-growing artificial intelligence program, has drawn praise for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, and attracted U.S. lawmakers' attention with questions about its impact on national security and education. ChatGPT was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, and a growing target for regulation. It was created by OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), and made available to the public for free. Its ubiquity has generated fear that generative AI such as ChatGPT could be used to spread disinformation, while educators worry it will be used by students to cheat. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat on the House of Representatives Science Committee, said in a recent opinion piece in the New York Times that he was excited about AI and the ""incredible ways it will continue to advance society,"" but also ""freaked out by A.I., specifically A.I. that is left unchecked and unregulated."" Lieu introduced a resolution written by ChatGPT that said Congress should focus on AI ""to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is done in a way that is safe, ethical, and respects the rights and privacy of all Americans, and that the benefits of AI are widely distributed and the risks are minimized."" In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman went to Capitol Hill where he met with tech-oriented lawmakers such as Senators Mark Warner, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal and Representative Jake Auchincloss, according to aides to the Democratic lawmakers. An aide to Wyden said the lawmaker pressed Altman on the need to make sure AI did not include biases that would lead to discrimination in the real world, like housing or jobs. ""While Senator Wyden believes AI has tremendous potential to speed up innovation and research, he is laser-focused on ensuring automated systems don't automate discrimination in the process,"" said Keith Chu, an aide to Wyden. A keyboard is seen reflected on a computer screen displaying the website of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot from OpenAI, in this illustration picture taken February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration A second congressional aide described the discussions as focusing on the speed of changes in AI and how it could be used. Prompted by worries about plagiarism, ChatGPT has already been banned in schools in New York and Seattle, according to media reports. One congressional aide said the concern they were hearing from constituents came mainly from educators focused on cheating. OpenAI said in a statement: ""We don't want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else, so we're already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system."" In an interview with Time, Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, said the company welcomed input, including from regulators and governments. ""It's not too early (for regulators to get involved),"" she said. Andrew Burt, managing partner of BNH.AI, a law firm focused on AI liability, pointed to the national security concerns, adding that he has spoken with lawmakers who are studying whether to regulate ChatGPT and similar AI systems such as Google's Bard, though he said he could not disclose their names. ""The whole value proposition of these types of AI systems is that they can generate content at scales and speeds that humans simply can't,"" he said. ""I would expect malicious actors, non-state actors and state actors that have interests that are adversarial to the United States to be using these systems to generate information that could be wrong or could be harmful."" ChatGPT itself, when asked how it should be regulated, demurred and said: ""As a neutral AI language model, I don't have a stance on specific laws that may or may not be enacted to regulate AI systems like me."" But it then went on to list potential areas of focus for regulators, such as data privacy, bias and fairness, and transparency in how answers are written.",2/13,,,0.4456020296,0.4342135489,0.1201843917,0.01138848066
ChatGPT frenzy sweeps China as firms scramble for home-grown options,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-frenzy-sweeps-china-firms-scramble-home-grown-options-2023-02-10/,"Microsoft-backed OpenAI has kept its hit ChatGPT app off-limits to users in China, but the app is attracting huge interest in the country, with firms rushing to integrate the technology into their products and launch rival solutions. While residents in the country are unable to create OpenAI accounts to access the artificial intelligence-powered (AI) chatbot, virtual private networks and foreign phone numbers are helping some bypass those restrictions. At the same time, the OpenAI models behind the ChatGPT programme, which can write essays, recipes and complex computer code, are relatively accessible in China and increasingly being incorporated into Chinese consumer technology applications from social networks to online shopping. The tool's surging popularity is rapidly raising awareness in China about how advanced U.S. AI is and, according to analysts, just how far behind tech firms in the world's second-largest economy are as they scramble to catch up. ""There is huge excitement around ChatGPT. Unlike the metaverse which faces huge difficulty in finding real-life application, ChatGPT has suddenly helped us achieve human-computer interaction,"" said Ding Daoshi, an independent internet analyst and former director of Beijing-based consultancy Sootoo. ""The changes it will bring about are more immediate, more direct and way quicker."" OpenAI or ChatGPT itself is not blocked by Chinese authorities but OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up. OpenAI told Reuters it is working to make its services more widely available. “While we would like to make our technology available everywhere, conditions in certain countries make it difficult or impossible for us to do so in a way that is consistent with our mission,"" the San Francisco-based firm said in an emailed statement. ""We are currently working to increase the number of locations where we can provide safe and beneficial access to our tools."" In December, Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) WeChat, China's biggest messaging app, shut several ChatGPT-related programmes that had appeared on the network, according to local media reports, but they have continued to spring up. Dozens of bots rigged to ChatGPT technology have emerged on WeChat, with hobbyists using it to make programmes or automated accounts that can interact with users. At least one account charges users a fee of 9.99 yuan ($1.47) to ask 20 questions. Tencent did not respond to Reuters' request for comments. ChatGPT supports Chinese language interaction and is highly capable of conversing in Chinese, which has helped drive its unofficial adoption in the country. Chinese firms also use proxy tools or existing partnerships with Microsoft, which is investing billions of dollars in its OpenAI, to access tools that allow them to embed AI technology into their products. Shenzhen-based Proximai in December introduced a virtual character into its 3D game-like social app who used ChatGPT's underlying tech to converse. Beijing-based entertainment software company Kunlun Tech plans to incorporate ChatGPT in its web browser Opera. SleekFlow, a Tiger Global-backed startup in Hong Kong, said it was integrating the AI into its customer relations messaging tools. ""We have clients all over the world,"" Henson Tsai, SleekFlow's founder said. ""Among other things, ChatGPT does excellent translations, sometimes better than other solutions available on the market."" CENSORSHIP Reuters' tests of ChatGPT indicate that the chatbot is not averse to questions that would be sensitive in mainland China. Asked for its thoughts on Chinese President Xi Jinping, for instance, it responded it does not have personal opinions and presented a range of views. But some of its proxy bots on WeChat have blacklisted such terms, according to other Reuters checks, complying with China's heavy censorship of its cyberspace. When asked the same question about Xi on one ChatGPT proxy bot, it responded by saying that the conversation violated rules. To comply with Chinese rules, Proximai's founder Will Duan said his platform would filter information presented to users during their interaction with ChatGPT. Chinese regulators, which last year introduced rules to strengthen governance of ""deepfake"" technology, have not commented on ChatGPT, however, state media this week warned about stock market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the internet regulator, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. ""With the regulations released last year, the Chinese government is saying: we already see this technology coming and we want to be ahead of the curve,"" said Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University. ""I fully expect the great majority of the AI-generated content to be non-political."" CHINESE RIVALS Joining the buzz have been some of the country's largest tech giants such as Baidu (9888.HK) and Alibaba (9988.HK) who gave updates this week on AI models they have been working on, prompting their shares to zoom. Baidu said this week it would complete internal testing of its ""Ernie Bot"" in March, a big AI model the search firm has been working on since 2019. On Wednesday, Alibaba said that its research institute Damo Academy was also testing a ChatGPT-style tool. Duan, whose company has been using a Baidu AI chatbot named Plato for natural language processing, said ChatGPT was at least a generation more powerful than China's current NLP solutions, though it was weaker in some areas, such as understanding conversation context. Baidu did not reply to Reuters' request for comments. Access to OpenAI's GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first launched in 2020, an update of which is the backbone of ChatGPT. Duan said potential long-term compliance risks mean Chinese companies would most likely replace ChatGPT with a local alternative, if they could match the U.S.-developed product's functionality. ""So we actually hope that there can be alternative solutions in China which we can directly use... it may handle Chinese even better, and it can also better comply with regulations,"" he said.

The move comes after Chinese state media on Thursday cautioned against risks in chasing local ChatGPT-concept stocks and as Hanwang on Friday flagged earnings risks. Shares of Hanwang and other Chinese developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services have surged as a global frenzy around the Microsoft (MSFT.O)-backed ChatGPT chatbot spurred speculative bets on revolutionary AI computing technology. ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S. firm OpenAI, gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries. Hanwang uses natural language processing (NLP) and human-machine interaction technology among others to provide ChatGPT-style products to specific areas such as finance, legal and government administration. Hanwang's shares slumped nearly 6% on Friday after the company flagged business, trading, and earnings risks at the request of the Shenzhen bourse and disclosed that several major shareholders had reduced their stakes. Still, the stock is up 65% so far this month. If a stock is put on the exchange's ""focus watch list"", it allows regulators to potentially demand fresh disclosures, impose restrictions on trading, or investigate related securities accounts for suspected misbehaviours if required. The regulatory scrutiny on Hanwang could further cool the frenzy around the technology that had pumped up shares in Chinese AI companies such as Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS) and CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (688327.SS).

ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S. firm OpenAI and backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries. Frenzy around the technology launched at November-end has seen shares of Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS) soar 217% this year.

Though some hotly chased concepts have been successful, ""many more new ideas haven't been commercialised, or require more time to prove,"" the state-backed newspaper said. ""However, some people avidly speculate on fake concepts, luring others into schemes of pumps and dumps. Investors eventually end up in tears so they should not follow."" Companies developing ChatGPT-like concepts have also flagged risks at the request of regulators after their prices shot up amid intense interest in generative AI - technology that can generate new data and media such as text and images. Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology said its ChatGPT-style products and services do not yet generate revenue, and that it has no relationship with OpenAI. Though such technology ""is on a long-term uptrend, we need to analyse its speed of growth, and effect, in a cool-headed way,"" it said in a filing in response to queries from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Alphabet shares dive after Google AI chatbot Bard flubs answer in ad,https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/,"Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) lost $100 billion in market value on Wednesday after its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company event failed to dazzle, feeding worries that the Google parent is losing ground to rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Alphabet shares slid as much as 9% during regular trading with volumes nearly three times the 50-day moving average. They pared losses after hours and were roughly flat. The stock had lost 40% of its value last year but rallied 15% since the beginning of this year, excluding Wednesday's losses. Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system. Google has been on its heels after OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. Google's live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated. Bard's error was discovered just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California. ""While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo."" Microsoft shares rose around 3% on Wednesday, and were flat in post-market trading. Alphabet posted a short GIF video of Bard in action via Twitter, promising it would help simplify complex topics, but it instead delivered an inaccurate answer. In the advertisement, Bard is given the prompt: ""What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year old about?"" Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system, or exoplanets. The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as confirmed by NASA. ""This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester program,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information."" FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR Alphabet is coming off a disappointing fourth quarter as advertisers cut spending. The search and advertising giant is moving quickly to keep pace with OpenAI and rivals, reportedly bringing in founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to accelerate its efforts. ""People are starting to question is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google's really bread-and-butter business,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares. Lip cautioned, though, that concerns about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: ""I think still Bing is a far, far cry away from Google's search capabilities."" The new ChatGPT software has injected excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so-called moonshot projects. AI has become a fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as six times more often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters, Reuters found. The appeal of AI-driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language, rather than in a list of links, which could make browsing faster and more efficient. It remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising, the backbone of search engines like Google. Chatbot AI systems also carry risks for corporations because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results, sexualize images or even plagiarize, as consumers testing the service have discovered. Microsoft, for instance, released a chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating racist content before being shut down. And an AI used by news site CNET was found to produce factually incorrect or plagiarized stories. At the time of writing, the Bard ad had been viewed on Twitter more than a million times.",2/8,,,0.09089992195,0.7829669118,0.1261332035,-0.6920669898

The Chinese e-commerce group's statement came after the 21st Century Herald newspaper reported that Alibaba is developing a ChatGPT-like dialogue robot which is currently open to employees for testing. When asked about the newspaper report, which also said that Alibaba might combine the technology with the group’s communication app DingTalk, Alibaba declined to comment. The company said it had been focused on large language models and generative AI for a number of years. Large language models are natural language processing systems which are trained on massive volumes of text, and are capable of answering and comprehending questions as well as generating new text. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares rose 3.2% premarket after the news. Shares in a number of other Chinese AI technology companies have soared in the past few days due to investor excitement over Open.Ai's ChatGPT, which can generate articles, essays and jokes in response to prompts and has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history.

Explainer: Bard vs ChatGPT: What do we know about Google's AI chatbot?,https://www.reuters.com/technology/bard-vs-chatgpt-what-do-we-know-about-googles-ai-chatbot-2023-02-07/,"Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and rival Microsoft (MSFT.O) are once again locked in a race to rule the internet zeitgeist after the Google owner launched ""Bard"" in answer to AI chatbot sensation ChatGPT. Just minutes after Google announced the launch of Bard on Monday, Microsoft said it would hold an event at its Redmond headquarters to reveal its own AI, potentially setting the stage for the next Chrome-versus-Internet Explorer or Gmail-versus-Hotmail. Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT has taken the tech world by storm since it was opened for public use last year, as people worldwide got creative with prompts that the conversational chatbot uses to create everything from poems and novels to jokes and film scripts. The artificial intelligence service could change how consumers search for information or create content on command and free up time for white-collar workers. Here are some key differences between Bard and ChatGPT: WHAT DO THEY DO? The services that Google's Bard and ChatGPT would offer are similar. Users will have to key in a question, a request or give a prompt to receive a human-like response. Microsoft and Google plan to embed AI tools to bolster their search services Bing and Google Search, which account for a big chunk of revenue. HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? Both technologies can distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, but the most apparent difference is Bard's ability to include recent events in the responses. Though not immediately clear how the two services will differ, it is certain that Alphabet's Bard will have access to more data. Bard draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT has access to data until 2021. LAMDA VERSUS GPT Bard is based on LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The AI generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed. OpenAI's GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first released in 2020, and the GPT 3.5 series of language models that finished training in early 2022 is the backbone of ChatGPT. ""ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,"" Open AI said in a blog post. WHEN WILL BARD BE AVAILABLE? While OpenAI made a free research preview of ChatGPT available for public use on Nov. 30 last year, Bard is currently only open to a group of testers. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post that the conversational AI service will be made widely available in the coming weeks. ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES? In the two months after ChatGPT's launch, a number of tech companies have doubled down on generative AI technology, while a number of startups are independently working on their own projects. Baidu, China's answer to Google, is the latest company to join the frenzy. Its AI is called Ernie.",2/7,,,0.1852662116,0.6304051876,0.1843286008,-0.445138976

The search engine giant's Hong Kong-listed shares closed up 15.3% on Tuesday, while its U.S shares climbed 11.2% in morning trade. A flurry of Chinese AI stocks also rallied, as the global frenzy around the Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) chatbot sensation ChatGPT spurred speculative bets on the new technology. Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history. It has prompted many tech firms to double down on the heavily hyped generative AI technology, which until recently existed more in the background than as a solid contributor to the bottom line. Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said on Monday it would launch a chatbot service and more AI for its search engine, while Microsoft plans its own AI reveal on Tuesday, underscoring growing rivalry to lead a new wave of computing. Baidu, China's answer to Google, joined the frenzy on Tuesday. It said Ernie，or ""Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration,"" is a large AI-powered language model introduced in 2019, and has gradually grown to be able to perform tasks including language understanding, language generation, and text-to-image generation. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Baidu was planning to launch such a service in March. The person said Baidu aims to make the service available as a standalone application and gradually merge it into its search engine by incorporating chatbot-generated results when users make search requests. ChatGPT and key Google services are not available in China, although some users have found workarounds to access such tools. Beijing-based Baidu has been a first mover in China on other tech trends. In late 2021, when the metaverse became a new buzzword, the company launched ""XiRang"" which it described as China's first metaverse platform. The platform however was widely panned for not offering a high-level, immersive experience and Baidu said it was a work in progress. The company has been investing heavily in AI technology, including in cloud services, chips and autonomous driving, as it looks to diversify its revenue sources.",2/7,,,0.418735981,0.4377439916,0.1435200274,-0.01900801063

Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history. That has pushed Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to plan its own chatbot service and using more artificial intelligence for its search engine. While ChatGPT is not accessible in China, mainland investors are still pumping up the shares of AI technology companies such as Hanwang Technology Co (002362.SZ), TRS Information Technology Co (300229.SZ) and Cloudwalk Technology Co (688327.SS). The CSI AI Industry Index (.CSI931071), which includes larger capitalized companies such as iFlytek Co (002230.SZ), is up about 17% this year, outperforming the benchmark CSI300 Index's (.CSI300) 6% rise. To be sure, there is no indication that these AI companies are close to pushing out a ChatGPT-like product. The closest seems to be search engine giant Baidu Inc (9888.HK) with plans to complete testing of its ""Ernie bot"" in March. Its shares surged more than 15% on Tuesday after making the announcement. ""The industry as a whole tends to first speculate on expectations before only later trading on actual results,"" said Zhang Kexing, general manager of Beijing Gelei Asset Management. Shares of Hanwang Technology, which makes products that enable intelligent interactions, jumped by their daily limit of 10% on Tuesday, the seventh consecutive session it has reached that limit since markets reopened from the Lunar New Year holiday, boosting prices by more than 60% so far in February. The company expects to report an annual loss for 2022 but believes it has an edge over an interface like ChatGPT because its model can produce more precise results for clients. Cloudwalk shares retreated 5.5% on Tuesday, but have nearly doubled in the seven trading days since the Lunar New Year holidays. On Tuesday, the company cautioned investors, saying its losses deepened in 2022, it has not cooperated with OpenAI, and has generated no revenues from ChatGPT-related services and products. Other companies that have disclosed their progress in AI technology include TRS Information Technology, and Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd (688787.SS). Their share prices have soared too. The price surge has stretched valuations. TRS for example, trades at nearly 60 times earnings, while Haitian Ruisheng's price-to-earnings ratio is more than 240.

"Google unveils ChatGPT rival Bard, AI search plans in battle with Microsoft",https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-opens-bard-chatbot-test-users-plans-more-ai-search-2023-02-06/,"Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) on Monday said it will launch a chatbot service and more artificial intelligence for its search engine as well as developers, an answer to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in their rivalry to lead a new wave of computing. Microsoft, meanwhile, said it planned its own AI reveal for Tuesday. The cascade of news reflects how Silicon Valley is anticipating massive change from so-called generative AI, technology that can create prose or other content on command and free up white-collar workers' time. The ascent of ChatGPT, a chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that could disrupt how consumers search for information, has been one of the biggest challenges to Google in recent memory. In a blog post, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said his company is opening a conversational AI service called Bard to test users for feedback, followed by a public release in the coming weeks. He also said Google plans to add AI features to its search engine that synthesize material for complex queries, like whether learning guitar or piano is easier. Currently, Google presents text that exists elsewhere on the Web for questions where the answer is clear. Google's update for search, the timing of which it did not disclose, reflects how the company is bolstering its service while Microsoft is doing the same for Bing, embedding OpenAI's capabilities in it. Microsoft has said it plans to imbue AI into its all its products and on Tuesday plans to brief news outlets on developments it did not specify, with its CEO Satya Nadella, according to an invitation seen by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted that he would also attend the event. How Google aims to differentiate Bard from OpenAI's ChatGPT was unclear. Pichai said the new service draws on information from the internet; ChatGPT's knowledge is up to date as of 2021. ""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our"" AI, Pichai said. Behind the new chatbot is LaMDA, Google's AI that generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed. In a demo of the service, Bard like its rival chatbot invites users to give it a prompt while warning its response may be inappropriate or inaccurate. It then bulleted three answers to a query about a space telescope's discoveries, the demo showed. Google is relying on a version of LaMDA that requires less computing power so it can serve more users and improve with their feedback, Pichai said. ChatGPT at times has turned away users because of explosive growth, with UBS analysts reporting it had 57 million unique visitors in December outpacing potentially TikTok in adoption. Google also plans to give technology tools, first powered by LaMDA and later by other AI, to creators and enterprises starting next month, Pichai said.",2/6,,,0.2426251322,0.6102789044,0.1470959336,-0.3676537722

Exclusive: ChatGPT in spotlight as EU's Breton bats for tougher AI rules,https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-breton-warns-chatgpt-risks-ai-rules-seek-tackle-concerns-2023-02-03/,"EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said new proposed artificial intelligence rules will aim to tackle concerns about the risks around the ChatGPT chatbot and AI technology, in the first comments on the app by a senior Brussels official. Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Some experts have raised fears that systems used by such apps could be misused for plagiarism, fraud and spreading misinformation, even as champions of artificial intelligence hail it as a technological leap. Breton said the risks posed by ChatGPT - the brainchild of OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) - and AI systems underscored the urgent need for rules which he proposed last year in a bid to set the global standard for the technology. The rules are currently under discussion in Brussels. ""As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great opportunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks. This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to ensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data,"" he told Reuters in written comments. Microsoft declined to comment on Breton's statement. OpenAI - whose app uses a technology called generative AI - did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI has said on its website it aims to produce artificial intelligence that ""benefits all of humanity"" as it attempts to build safe and beneficial AI. Under the EU draft rules, ChatGPT is considered a general purpose AI system which can be used for multiple purposes including high-risk ones such as the selection of candidates for jobs and credit scoring. Breton wants OpenAI to cooperate closely with downstream developers of high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the proposed AI Act. ""Just the fact that generative AI has been newly included in the definition shows the speed at which technology develops and that regulators are struggling to keep up with this pace,"" a partner at a U.S. law firm, said. 'HIGH RISK' WORRIES Companies are worried about getting their technology classified under the ""high risk"" AI category which would lead to tougher compliance requirements and higher costs, according to executives of several companies involved in developing artificial intelligence. A survey by industry body appliedAI showed that 51% of the respondents expect a slowdown of their AI development activities as a result of the AI Act. Effective AI regulations should centre on the highest risk applications, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. ""There are days when I'm optimistic and moments when I'm pessimistic about how humanity will put AI to use,"" he said. Breton said the European Commission is working closely with the EU Council and European Parliament to further clarify the rules in the AI Act for general purpose AI systems. ""People would need to be informed that they are dealing with a chatbot and not with a human being. Transparency is also important with regard to the risk of bias and false information,"" he said. Generative AI models need to be trained on huge amount of text or images for creating a proper response leading to allegations of copyright violations. Breton said forthcoming discussions with lawmakers about AI rules would cover these aspects. Concerns about plagiarism by students have prompted some U.S. public schools and French university Sciences Po to ban the use of ChatGPT.",2/3,,,0.1540431231,0.7391775846,0.1067792997,-0.5851344615

""In 20 years following the internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer internet app,"" UBS analysts wrote in the note. It took TikTok about nine months after its global launch to reach 100 million users and Instagram 2-1/2 years, according to data from Sensor Tower. ChatGPT can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), made it available to the public for free in late November. On Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said. Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses. The company said the subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost. Availability of the tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation. Last month, Microsoft announced another multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in the form of cash and provision of cloud computing.",2/2,,,0.4948290884,0.3452264965,0.1599444002,0.149602592

ChatGPT owner launches 'imperfect' tool to detect AI-generated text,https://www.reuters.com/business/chatgpt-owner-launches-imperfect-tool-detect-ai-generated-text-2023-01-31/,"OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, has released a software tool to identify text generated by artificial intelligence, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. ChatGPT is a free program that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, which has gained wide popularity since its debut in November, while raising concerns about copyright and plagiarism. The AI classifier, a language model trained on the dataset of pairs of human-written and AI-written text on the same topic, aims to distinguish text that is written by AI. It uses a variety of providers to address issues such as automated misinformation campaigns and academic dishonesty, the company said. In its public beta mode, OpenAI acknowledges the detection tool is very unreliable on texts under 1,000 characters, and AI-written text can be edited to trick the classifier. ""We’re making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful,"" OpenAI said. “We recognize that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom."" Since ChatGPT debuted in November and gained wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest U.S. school districts, including New York City, have banned the AI chatbot over concerns that students will use the text generator to cheat or plagiarize. Others have created third-party detection tools including GPTZeroX to help educators detect AI-generated text. OpenAI said it is engaging with educators to discuss ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations, and will continue to work on the detection of AI-generated text.",2/1,,,0.3792735338,0.4898574054,0.130869031,-0.1105838716

China's Baidu to launch ChatGPT-style bot in March - source,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-baidu-launch-chatgpt-style-bot-march-source-2023-01-30/,"Chinese internet search major Baidu Inc (9888.HK) is planning to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot service similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT in March, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The technology firm plans to launch the service as a standalone application and gradually merge it into its search engine, said the person, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential. ChatGPT's technology works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer prompts by users in a human-like manner, offering information like a search engine or even prose like an aspiring novelist. Chatbots in China currently focus on social interaction whereas ChatGPT performs better at more professional tasks, such as programming and essay writing. Baidu plans to incorporate chatbot-generated results when users make search requests, instead of only links, the person said. Baidu declined to comment. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.

Top French university bans use of ChatGPT to prevent plagiarism,https://www.reuters.com/technology/top-french-university-bans-use-chatgpt-prevent-plagiarism-2023-01-27/,"Sciences Po, one of France's top universities, has banned the use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that can generate coherent prose, to prevent fraud and plagiarism. ChatGPT is a free programme that generates original text about virtually any subject in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, raising concerns across industries about plagiarism. The university said on Friday the school had emailed all students and faculty announcing a ban on ChatGPT and all other AI-based tools at Sciences Po. ""Without transparent referencing, students are forbidden to use the software for the production of any written work or presentations, except for specific course purposes, with the supervision of a course leader,"" Sciences Po said, though it did not specify how it would track usage. ChatGPT has already been banned in some public schools in New York City and Seattle, according to U.S. media reports, while several U.S. universities have announced plans to do fewer take-home assessments and more hand-written essays and oral exams. Sciences Po, whose main campus is in Paris, added that punishment for using the software may go as far as exclusion from the institution, or even from French higher education as a whole. ""The ChatGPT software is raising important questions for educators and researchers all around the world, with regards to fraud in general, and particularly plagiarism,"" it said .

ChatGPT passes law school exams despite 'mediocre' performance,https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/chatgpt-passes-law-school-exams-despite-mediocre-performance-2023-01-25/,"ChatGPT cannot yet outscore most law students on exams, new research suggests, but it can eke out a passing grade. A quartet of law professors at the University of Minnesota used the popular artificial intelligence chatbot to generate answers to exams in four courses last semester, then graded them blindly alongside actual students' tests. ChatGPT’s average C+ performance fell below the humans' B+ average, the authors said. If applied across the curriculum, that would still be enough to earn the chatbot a law degree—though it would be placed on academic probation at Minnesota, ranked as the 21st best law school in the country by U.S. News & World Report. ""Alone, ChatGPT would be pretty mediocre law student,"" said lead study author Jonathan Choi, who collaborated with professors Kristin Hickman, Amy Monahan and Daniel Schwarcz. ""The bigger potential for the profession here is that a lawyer could use ChatGPT to produce a rough first draft and just make their practice that much more effective,"" he said. Choi said he and many colleagues have now banned Internet use during in-class exams to eliminate the possibility of cheating with ChatGPT, though future exams may test their ability to effectively leverage artificial intelligence programs. The wildly popular ChatGPT debuted in late November and is free for users. It generates sophisticated, human-like responses based on requests from users and mountains of data, including from legal texts. Other legal academics have also been experimenting with the program. Suffolk University law dean Andrew Perlman co-authored a scholarly article with the program in December. Two other law professors had ChatGPT answer multiple-choice questions from the bar exam. It did not pass but performed better than expected. The Minnesota law professors had ChatGPT take exams in torts, employee benefits, taxation, and aspects of constitutional law. The tests included a total of 95 multiple choice questions and 12 essay questions. The chatbot generally did better on the essays than the multiple-choice questions, scoring in the 17th percentile of all students and the 7th percentile, respectively. But its essay performance was inconsistent. “In writing essays, ChatGPT displayed a strong grasp of basic legal rules and had consistently solid organization and composition,” the authors wrote. “However, it struggled to identify relevant issues and often only superficially applied rules to facts as compared to real law students.” The program scored higher on the multiple-choice questions than it would through pure chance, according to the report, but struggled to correctly answer questions involving math. ChatGPT’s exam grades ranged from a high of a B in constitutional law to a low of C-in torts and taxation.",1/25,,,0.3844163716,0.355371207,0.2602123916,0.02904516459
Davos 2023: CEOs buzz about ChatGPT-style AI at World Economic Forum,https://www.reuters.com/technology/davos-2023-ceos-buzz-about-chatgpt-style-ai-world-economic-forum-2023-01-17/,"Business titans trudging through Alpine snow can't stop talking about a chatbot from San Francisco. Generative artificial intelligence, tech that can invent virtually any content someone can think up and type into a text box, is garnering not just venture investment in Silicon Valley but interest in Davos at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting this week. Defining the category is ChatGPT, a chatbot that the startup called OpenAI released in November. The tech works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer any prompt by a user in a human-like way, offering information like a search engine would or prose like an aspiring novelist. Executives have floated wide-ranging applications for the nascent technology, from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for AI and military supremacy. Conference goers with a major stake in the development of the technology include Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), whose chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the tech's progress has not been linear. AI capabilities will ""completely transform"" all of Microsoft's products, he said in an on-stage interview with the Wall Street Journal. Microsoft has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. In an announcement that coincided with the conference, Microsoft said it plans to market ChatGPT to its cloud-computing customers. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google. Later on Tuesday, the political sphere gets to weigh in on the craze. French politician Jean-Noël Barrot planned to join a panel discussion with a Sony Group Corp (6758.T) executive on the technology's impact. Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare Inc (NET.N), a company that defends websites against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, sees generative AI as good enough to be a junior programmer or a ""really good thought partner."" In an interview, Prince said Cloudflare was using such technology to write code on its Workers platform. Cloudflare is also exploring how such tech can answer inquiries faster for its free-tier customers as well, he said on the annual meeting's sidelines. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR.N), a software provider helping governments visualise an army's movements or enterprises vet their supply chains, among other tasks, said such AI could have military applications. Karp told Reuters in Davos, ""The idea that an autonomous thing could generate results is basically obviously useful for war."" The country that advances the fastest in AI capabilities is ""going to define the law of the land,"" Karp said, adding that it was worth asking how tech would play a role in any conflict with China. Businesses including CarMax Inc (KMX.N) have already used Microsoft and OpenAI's tech, such as to generate thousands of customer review summaries when marketing used vehicles. Proposed venture-capital investment has also exceeded what some startups want to take. Such buzz carried through gatherings at Davos, like talk about a slide-generating bot dubbed ChatBCG after the management consulting firm. The service said on its website that it had too much demand to keep operating. Generative AI is ""a game-changer that society and industry need to be ready for,"" stated an article on the World Economic Forum's website.",1/20,,,0.5991439819,0.2783272266,0.1225287914,0.3208167553
Microsoft to expand ChatGPT access as OpenAI investment rumors swirl,https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-expand-chatgpt-access-openai-investment-rumors-swirl-2023-01-17/,"Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday said it is widening access to hugely popular software from OpenAI, a startup it is backing whose futuristic ChatGPT chatbot has captivated Silicon Valley. Microsoft said the startup's tech, which it so far has previewed to its cloud-computing customers in a program it called the Azure OpenAI Service, was now generally available, a distinction that's expected to bring a flood of new usage. The news comes as Microsoft has looked at adding to the $1 billion stake in OpenAI it announced in 2019, two people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. The news site Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft might invest $10 billion; Microsoft declined to comment on any potential deal. Public interest in OpenAI surged following its November release of ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command. ChatGPT is powered by generative artificial intelligence, which conjures new content after training on vast amounts of data -- tech that Microsoft is letting more customers apply to use. ChatGPT itself, not just its underlying tech, will soon be available via Microsoft's cloud, it said in a blog post. Microsoft said it is vetting customers' applications to mitigate potential abuse of the software, and its filters can screen for harmful content users might input or the tech might produce. The business potential of such software has garnered massive venture-capital investment in startups producing it, at a time funding has otherwise dried up. Already, some companies have used the tech to create marketing content or demonstrate how it could negotiate a cable bill. Microsoft said CarMax, KPMG and others were using its Azure OpenAI service.

Some law professors fear ChatGPT's rise as others see opportunity,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/some-law-professors-fear-chatgpts-rise-others-see-opportunity-2023-01-10/,"The artificial intelligence program ChatGPT came up short last month on the multiple choice portion of the bar exam. The free chatbot from OpenAI performed better than predicted, however, earning passing scores on evidence and torts. The academics behind the experiment expect it will pass the attorney licensing test someday. Law professors are among those both alarmed and delighted by ChatGPT since its November release. The program generates sophisticated, human-like responses based on requests from users and mountains of data, including from legal texts. Daniel Linna, director of law and technology initiatives at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, said most law professors thinking about language-based AI are concerned with students passing off work generated by the chatbot as their own. But others see AI as a tool for legal education, and warn that without it law students may be unprepared for legal careers in which technology will play ever larger roles. Jake Heller, chief executive officer of legal tech company Casetext, said law schools should encourage students to use ChatGPT and similar tools as a starting point for documents and a way to generate ideas. “It’s no different than turning to a friend in the law library late and night and saying, ‘Hey, I’m struggling with this idea,’” Heller said. “It’s like using a calculator in math.” Andrew Perlman, dean of Suffolk University Law School, said he would like to see first-year legal research and writing classes cover the use of tools like ChatGPT, just as they teach students to conduct research on Westlaw and LexisNexis. “We’re at a very interesting inflection point,” Perlman said. “It would not surprise me if professionals of the future will be expected to make queries to chatbots and other tools to at least get an initial draft of a document.” ChatGPT is not yet sophisticated enough to earn a law student an “A” without additional work, said Northwestern's Linna. There are also law-focused AI tools that do a better job on specific tasks, he added. In their Dec. 31 paper on GPT 3.5's performance on the bar exam, Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Daniel Martin Katz and Michigan State University College of Law adjunct Michael Bommarito found that the program got answers on the Multistate Bar Exam correct half the time, compared to 68% for human test takers. Those limitations are not enough to soothe many skeptics. Among them is South Texas College of Law Houston law professor Josh Blackman, who urged professors to rethink take-home exams in a recent post on the Volokh Conspiracy blog. “This technology should strike fear in all academics,” he wrote, noting that ChatGPT produces original text that cannot be identified by existing plagiarism detection software. Heller predicted that law schools will soon begin to amend their codes of conduct and professors will need to clarify that simply turning in a paper produced by a chatbot is akin to plagiarism. Law professors may begin to ask students to disclose what specific technology tools they used, Perlman added. “Given how rapidly the technology seems to be progressing, these are conversations that are going to have to happen sooner rather than later,” he said.",1/10,,,0.2525822818,0.4637818038,0.2836358845,-0.211199522

The funding could also include other venture firms and documents sent to prospective investors outlining its terms indicated a targeted close by the end of 2022, according to the report. Microsoft declined to comment, while OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The software giant had in 2019 invested $1 billion in OpenAI, founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Microsoft's cloud services arm also provides the computing power needed by the AI firm. Microsoft last year unveiled plans to integrate image-generation software from OpenAI into its search engine Bing. A recent report from the Information said similar plans were underway for ChatGPT as Microsoft looks to take on market leader Google Search. According to Semafor, Microsoft will also get 75% of OpenAI's profits until it recoups its initial investment. After hitting that threshold, Microsoft would have a 49% stake in OpenAI, with other investors taking another 49% and OpenAI's nonprofit parent getting 2%, Semafor said. Reuters reported last month a recent pitch by OpenAI to investors said the organization expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024. OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt.

But a question it can't fully answer is this: How will OpenAI make money? The research organization, co-founded by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman and backed by $1 billion in funding from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), is expecting its business to surge. Three sources briefed on OpenAI's recent pitch to investors said the organization expects $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024. The forecast, first reported by Reuters, represents how some in Silicon Valley are betting the underlying technology will go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos. OpenAI was most recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. The startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2. OpenAI charges developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate 20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt, according to its website. A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on its financials and strategy. The company, which started releasing commercial products in 2020, has said its mission remains advancing AI safely for humanity. In a taste of what's to come, startups including Synthesia and Jasper, the latter having relied on OpenAI's tech, have drawn Fortune 500 companies to use their video-generation or AI copywriting tools, according to their websites. OpenAI has also attracted attention as an AI provider and potential Google search competitor, with ChatGPT answering queries for more than 1 million users so far. Microsoft, providing OpenAI capital and computing power for its software, is a beneficiary. Asked about ChatGPT and whether Microsoft viewed such technology as experimental or strategic, its President Brad Smith told Reuters that AI has progressed faster than many predicted. ""We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future, but for everyone's future,"" he said in an interview this week. Some investors expressed skepticism. Certain large venture-capital firms passed on backing OpenAI this year, questioning if it could justify a higher valuation or compete with rivals like Alphabet Inc-owned (GOOGL.O) Google, sources familiar with its fundraise attempt who did not invest said. A ""capped-profit"" structure that OpenAI created in 2019 also represented an unusual restriction for venture capital. OpenAI wanted to safeguard its mission by limiting backers' returns to 100 times their investment, or less in the future. Others may be doubling down. Microsoft this year has looked at adding to its stake, two other sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal previously reported. Its hope is to drive business for Microsoft's cloud as more enterprises embrace AI. MARKETING GURU ChatGPT is based on what's known as a large language model, trained with text data so it can answer prompts like a human. Similarly powerful technology that Google built and is narrowly testing with users led one of its engineers this year to say the software was sentient. Reality is far from that, many scientists say. ChatGPT's responses at times can be inaccurate or inappropriate, though it's built to decline hateful prompts and improve with feedback. OpenAI warns users, ChatGPT ""may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content."" The potential to generate flawed answers is one reason why a big player like Google has guarded public access closely, concerned that chatbots could harm users and damage its reputation. Google declined to comment. The caution has created a void that startups have sought to fill. A company called Cohere, run partly by ex-Googlers, is working on commercial products after a $125 million fundraise led by Tiger Global in February. Another, Adept, announced a $65 million raise in April, and Stability AI touted $101 million in funding after the August release of its text-to-image generator. Among those building applications atop OpenAI has been Jasper, which says it has drawn 80,000 marketers to draft ads, emails, blogs or other content with its software. The fast-growing company is expected to double its revenue to about $80 million this year, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its chief executive did not comment on the figure. Gil Elbaz, co-founder of TenOneTen Ventures, said marketing represented one of the clearest businesses for today's chatbots. CarMax Inc (KMX.N), for instance, has used OpenAI through Microsoft's cloud to create thousands of customer review summaries for used cars that it is marketing, a case study on Microsoft's website shows. Victor Riparbelli, CEO of text-to-video startup Synthesia, said money so far is ""in a lot of the more boring use cases."" His London-based company has more than 20,000 customers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) using its software, which can generate corporate training and product marketing videos, though longer term the goal is AI producing Hollywood-quality content, he said. Amazon confirmed its use of the technology. Such startups risk OpenAI or Big Tech companies spotting lucrative applications and copying them, which is why Synthesia built its key software in-house. At the same time, application developers could win out financially if technology like OpenAI's becomes a commodity, said Alan Cowen, chief executive at research startup Hume AI and a former Google researcher. For now, OpenAI must determine how to sustain ChatGPT while shouldering what its CEO Altman described as ""eye-watering"" operating costs. ""I don't think OpenAI intended to make a business out of ChatGPT. I think it functions as a demo ... and a way to gather human feedback for free,"" said Cowen. ""Usage grew a lot faster than expected, so they are now contemplating monetization.""",12/15,,,0.3579397202,0.4396004975,0.2024597377,-0.08166077733
Will ChatGPT make lawyers obsolete? (Hint: be afraid),https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/will-chatgpt-make-lawyers-obsolete-hint-be-afraid-2022-12-09/,"Suffolk University Law School Dean Andrew Perlman set what could be a speed record for writing a 14-page law article: One hour. Or rather, I should say co-wrote -- he shared the byline with OpenAI’s new chatbot. Published earlier this week by the Social Science Research Network, their treatise strikes me as equal parts fascinating and alarming – and points to potentially profound changes ahead for the legal profession. No, lawyers won’t be replaced by artificial intelligence. Yet. Give it a few years. As my Reuters colleagues reported, San Francisco-based OpenAI made its latest creation, the ChatGPT chatbot, available for free public testing on Nov. 30. Based on user prompts, it offers human-sounding responses that feel significantly less artificial and more intelligent than earlier forays into AI. The bot has quickly become a social media sensation. It can come up with jokes! Suggest a holiday menu! Write a five-paragraph essay on the symbolism of the green light in “The Great Gatsby”! And, as it turns out, mimic the work of lawyers, with varying degrees of success. “I’ve always enjoyed technology and been interested in the role it can play in the delivery of legal services,” Perlman told me. When he heard about ChatGPT, he said, he was quick to try it out -- and was “blown away, as so many people are.” Inspired, he set out to write “an article that discusses its implications for legal services providers,” he said. Perlman gave ChatGPT a series of prompts: Draft a brief to the United States Supreme Court on why its decision on same-sex marriage should not be overturned; Explain the concept of personal jurisdiction; Develop a list of deposition questions for the plaintiff in a routine motor vehicle accident; Create a contract for the sale of real estate in Massachusetts -- and half a dozen others. And then verbatim, he offered its responses. They’re … not bad. The bot “isn’t ready for prime time,” Perlman said. But also, it doesn’t seem all that far off. I reached out to ChatGPT maker OpenAI to ask about the technology's advantages and limitations but did not immediately hear back from a human. I did, however, talk to the bot itself about its capabilities. More on that below. What's clear though is that the bot has the makings of an advocate, at least on paper. Consider its response in part to the same-sex marriage prompt, where it wrote that the court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges “is firmly rooted in the principle of equality under the law. The Constitution guarantees all individuals the equal protection of the laws, and this includes the right to marry the person of one's choosing. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry would be a clear violation of this principle.” The bot goes on to note that Obergefell “is consistent with a long line of precedent establishing the fundamental right to marry. In Loving v. Virginia, the Court held that marriage is one of the ‘basic civil rights of man,’ and that the right to marry is protected by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.” It’s a pretty solid effort – though I also think it’s safe to say that the bot is unlikely to put Supreme Court advocates out of work, now or ever. But for more routine legal issues? The technology offers “significant potential to address access to justice questions” in making legal services available to people of limited means, Perlman noted. According to a 2022 report by the Legal Services Corp, “low-income Americans do not get any or enough legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.” In the paper, the bot offers sensible-sounding advice on how to go about correcting a social security payment or what to do if you disagree with your child’s school district about the creation of an Individualized Education Program. I test drove it myself, asking it to explain what constitutes a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum case -- and then got my husband, an immigration lawyer, to evaluate the answer. “It’s all correct,” he said, adding that what the bot produced was more lucid than some writing he's seen from real-live practitioners. But here’s the thing. The bot creators on the OpenAI website also note that ChatGPT shouldn’t be relied upon for advice, and that it “sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.” If a lawyer did that, there could be malpractice consequences -- but if the bot steers you wrong, too bad. This is where I might normally call a legal ethics expert for comment. But no need. The bot offers its own critique, telling me straight up, ""It is not ethical for me to provide legal advice as I am not a qualified legal professional."" Perlman in the paper gets a more detailed response. “Because ChatGPT is a machine learning system, it may not have the same level of understanding and judgment as a human lawyer when it comes to interpreting legal principles and precedent,"" the bot writes. ""This could lead to problems in situations where a more in-depth legal analysis is required."" ChatGPT is also aware that it could one day “be used to replace human lawyers and legal professionals, potentially leading to job losses and economic disruption.” Perlman agrees that’s a concern. But he doesn’t see it as an either/or situation. Lawyers could use the technology to enhance their work, he said, and produce “something better than machine or human could do alone.” ChatGPT apparently thinks so, too. In the final prompt, Perlman asked it to write a poem (suffice to say, Amanda Gorman needn't sweat the competition) about how it will change legal services. “ChatGPT will guide us through with ease,” the bot wrote. “It will be a trusted companion and guard / Helping us to provide the best legal services with expertise.”",12/9,,,0.1161595955,0.7685075402,0.1153328344,-0.6523479447
Explainer: ChatGPT - what is OpenAI’s chatbot and what is it used for?,https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-what-is-openais-chatbot-what-is-it-used-2022-12-05/,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in emerging technologies continues to advance rapidly. San Francisco-based OpenAI made its latest creation, the ChatGPT chatbot, available for free public testing on Nov. 30. A chatbot is a software application designed to mimic human-like conversation based on user prompts. Within a week of ChatGPT being unveiled, over a million users had tried to make the tool talk, according to Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. WHO OWNS OPENAI AND IS ELON MUSK INVOLVED? OpenAI, a research and development firm, was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 by Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman and billionaire Elon Musk and attracted funding from several others, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In 2019, the group created a related for-profit entity to take in outside investment. Musk, who remains engulfed in his overhaul of social networking firm Twitter, left OpenAI’s board in 2018, but chimed in with his take on the viral phenomenon, calling it ""scary good"". Musk later tweeted that he was pausing OpenAI’s access to Twitter’s database after learning that the firm was using it to ""train"" the tool. HOW OPENAI'S CHATGPT WORKS OpenAI states that their ChatGPT model, trained using a machine learning technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), can simulate dialogue, answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests. Initial development involved human AI trainers providing the model with conversations in which they played both sides – the user and an AI assistant. The version of the bot available for public testing attempts to understand questions posed by users and responds with in-depth answers resembling human-written text in a conversational format. WHAT COULD IT BE USED FOR? A tool like ChatGPT could be used in real-world applications such as digital marketing, online content creation, answering customer service queries or as some users have found, even to help debug code. The bot can respond to a large range of questions while imitating human speaking styles. IS IT PROBLEMATIC? As with many AI-driven innovations, ChatGPT does not come without misgivings. OpenAI has acknowledged the tool’s tendency to respond with ""plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,"" an issue it considers challenging to fix. AI technology can also perpetuate societal biases like those around race, gender and culture. Tech giants including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) have previously acknowledged that some of their projects that experimented with AI were ""ethically dicey"" and had limitations. At several companies, humans had to step in and fix AI havoc. Despite these concerns, AI research remains attractive. Venture capital investment in AI development and operations companies rose last year to nearly $13 billion, and $6 billion had poured in through October this year, according to data from PitchBook, a Seattle company tracking financings.",12/5,,,0.3748427927,0.4932103753,0.1319468319,-0.1183675826
