  body: "The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) has blocked OpenAI\u2019s
    ChatGPT service access on its networks and devices amid fears that students will
    use it to cheat on assignments and other school tasks. ChatGPT is an artificial
    intelligence chatbot capable of producing content mimicking human speech. Accessible
    for free, the service can be used to generate essays, technical documents, and
    poetry,\_Chalkbeat New York\_reported. The program uses machine learning to pull
    and compile historical facts and even make logical arguments that sound convincing,
    all the while ensuring that the output remains grammatically correct. \u201CDue
    to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding
    the safety and accuracy of content, access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York
    City Public Schools\u2019 networks and devices,\u201D NYCDOE\_spokesperson Jenna
    Lyle told Chalkbeat. \u201CWhile the tool may be able to provide quick and easy
    answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving
    skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.\u201D However,
    if individual schools do need access to the site in case they wish to study the
    technology powering ChatGPT, they only need to put in a request, Lyle said. ChatGPT
    and School Tasks In an interview with the\_New York Post, Darren Hick, an assistant
    philosophy professor at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, said
    that academia \u201Cdid not see this coming,\u201D referring to the capabilities
    of ChatGPT. In early December, Hick had asked his class to write a 500-word essay
    on philosopher David Hume and the paradox of horror. One of the submissions caught
    his eye as it featured a few hallmarks of having been created by AI. \u201CIt\u2019s
    a clean style. But it\u2019s recognizable. I would say it writes like a very smart
    12th grader,\u201D Hick told the New York Post, adding that the bot uses \u201Cpeculiar\u201D
    and \u201Codd wording.\u201D Dangers of AI A problem with ChatGPT is that it is
    not always correct. OpenAI\_admits\_that ChatGPT \u201Csometimes writes plausible-sounding
    but incorrect or nonsensical answers,\u201D and that fixing the issue is a challenge.
    As such, the service cannot be used to source critical information, like medical
    advice. Many people have been raising alarm bells over the rising development
    of AI. In June of last year, Google put a senior software engineer in its Responsible
    AI ethics group on paid administrative leave after he raised concerns about the
    human-like behavior exhibted by LaMDA, an AI program he tested. The employee tried
    to convince Google to take a look at the potentially serious \u201Csentient\u201D
    behavior of the AI. However, the company did not heed his words, he claimed. Tech
    billionaire Elon Musk has also warned about the dangers of AI. \u201CI have exposure
    to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about
    it,\u201D Musk\_told\_attendees of a National Governors Association meeting in
    July 2017. \u201CI keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going
    down the street killing people, they don\u2019t know how to react, because it
    seems so ethereal.\u201D"

- !!python/object:ai_sentiment.data.ClassificationTarget
  body: "\u201CHumans deserve to know the truth,\u201D said Edward Tian, a senior
    student at Princeton University, who launched GPTZero, an artificial intelligence
    (AI) text detection tool,\_over his holiday break. \u201CNo one wants to be deceived,
    whether something they\u2019re reading online is misrepresented as human-written
    or machine-written,\u201D\_ Tian told The Epoch Times on Jan. 22. \u201CSo everyone
    really deserves a tool like GPTZero,\u201D\_he said. Tian, who is studying both
    computer science and journalism, created\_GPTZero through the Princeton Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) lab. \u201CI released this app the day after New Year,
    expecting, at best, a few dozen people trying it out, and it completely blew up
    and went viral. And over 300,000 people have tried using it online now, which
    is incredible,\u201D Tian said. \u201COn January 3, it crashed because too many
    people were using it. And the hosting platform reached out to me and very generously
    bumped up our memory and hosting,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd now we have more than
    23k educators signed up on the (GPTZero product) waitlist from over 40 states
    and 30 countries. So it\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201D \u2018AI is Here to Stay\u2019
    Like a lot of people, Tian thinks that AI is very useful, but he said the\_technology
    needs safeguards. On Tian\u2019s website, it says: \u201CGPTZero turns the very
    technologies used to build ChatGPT around\u2014to detect AI. It uses variables
    like perplexity to fingerprint AI involvement.\u201D Tian has been aware of some
    GPT technologies for a while, including the different iterations of GPT 2, 3,
    and 3.5. He and his friends began using the ChatGPT AI chatbot late last year.
    \u201CWe were definitely struck by how accessible it is,\u201D said Tian, who
    initially used ChatGPT with friends to write poems. \u201CWe were surprised at
    how good the program is, sometimes it writes better than myself. So it is pretty
    fun,\u201D he said. \u201CIt was like all around us on campus.\u201D The inspiration
    for GPTZero is the idea that \u201Ceverybody deserves to know the truth on whether
    something is a machine or human generated,\u201D he said. \u201CI think ChatGPT
    is an incredible and brilliant innovation. But at the same time, it\u2019s like
    opening Pandora\u2019s box, and once it\u2019s open, there\u2019s a lot of potential
    for misuse. And that\u2019s kind of like a scary world,\u201D he said. \u201C[GPTZero]
    is not to stop this technology from being adopted. Instead, it\u2019s that this
    technology needs to be adopted responsibly. And to do that, we need to be able
    to see where and when it is being used,\u201D he said. \u201CPersonally, I think
    AI is here to stay, that AI is the future. We have to enter this future responsibly
    and build safeguards,\_ so we\u2019re adopting these new technologies safely.\u201D
    Accuracy Rate Regarding the accuracy rates of the GPTZero app, Tian said, \u201CThere\u2019s
    a lot of edge cases we\u2019re still handling.\u201D \u201CI would say the beta
    [version] that\u2019s released and publicly available online\u2014we don\u2019t
    want people making academic decisions from that. That\u2019s tested on journalist
    articles, and it has an accuracy rate of 98.\u201D Tian said that he and some
    of his college friends are now building a tool that teachers can use professionally.
    \u201CWe\u2019re building out an actual tool that educators can use with improved
    models, as well as handles mixed between AI and human-generated text,\u201D he
    said. ChatGPT Controversy ChatGPT has caused widespread controversy among educators
    since it was created on Nov.30 last year. Some U.S. schools, such as public schools
    in New York City and Seattle, have blocked ChatGPT service access on their networks
    and devices amid fears that students will use it to cheat on assignments and the
    negative impacts it could have on student learning. A new research paper at the\_University
    of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School stated that ChatGPT had passed a graduate-level
    business examination. But Tian doesn\u2019t think these blanket bans on ChatGPT
    in schools are the right approach. \u201CI\u2019m not for these blanket bans of
    ChatGPT in schools because students will just find ways to get around it,\u201D
    said Tian. \u201CSo instead of ignoring this future, we shouldn\u2019t be entering
    the future blindly. And we should be adopting these technologies more responsibly.\u201D
    Future Goals Tian was born in Tokyo and grew up mostly in Toronto. His grandparents
    in Beijing helped raise him and his sibling when he was very young. Tian said
    both of his parents are computer scientists, and he is pretty into the technology
    field. And his grandfather was a university professor, and his grandmother was
    an electrical engineer who graduated from Tsinghua University. They were very
    instrumental in his education to be exposed to new technologies as well. Tian
    said he has not decided on his future career goal. \u201CBut I definitely want
    to work at the intersection of technology and journalism, whether it\u2019s natural
    language processing or data journalism,\u201D he said. His major is in computer
    science, and his minor is in journalism at Princeton. Tian believes AI cannot
    replace human writing, so he also chose to study journalism. \u201CI think it\u2019s
    important to preserve aspects of human writing as well, and human originality
    and writing will remain an important skill for years to come,\u201D said Tian.
    \u201CBecause these large language models aren\u2019t writing anything unique.
    They\u2019re not coming up with anything original. They\u2019re taking huge portions
    of the internet and then repatterning them. So I think writing will remain a really
    important skill.\u201D His team wants to start working on other languages for
    GPTZero, \u201Cbecause we\u2019ve been contacted by teachers from across the world,
    from Switzerland, France, India, Australia, and China,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019re
    committed to keeping a version of the beta free and accessible online for everybody
    to use,\u201D\_Tian added."

  title: AI Adoption Needs to Be Done Responsibly, Says Student Creator of App That
    Detects Chatbot Generated Text
- !!python/object:ai_sentiment.data.ClassificationTarget
  body: "Google published an online advertisement in which its much-anticipated AI
    chatbot Bard delivered an inaccurate answer. Introduced on Feb. 6, Bard was touted
    in an online ad by Google that ran in the company\u2019s Twitter feed. In the
    tweet, Google described the chatbot as a \u201Claunchpad for curiosity\u201D that
    would help simplify complex topics\u2014and included a short GIF video ad of Bard
    in action. In the ad, Bard is given the prompt: \u201CWhat new discoveries from
    the James Webb Space Telescope (or JWST), can I tell my 9-year old about?\u201D
    Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was
    used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth\u2019s solar
    system, or exoplanets. This is inaccurate. The first pictures of exoplanets were
    taken by the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in 2004,
    as confirmed by NASA. The error was spotted hours before Google hosted a launch
    event for Bard in Paris, where a Google senior executive touted Bard as the future
    of the company. Google\u2019s launch event came one day after Microsoft unveiled
    plans to integrate its rival AI chatbot ChatGPT into its Bing search engine and
    other products. As for Bard\u2019s mistake, a Google spokesperson told Reuters:
    \u201CThis highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something
    that we\u2019re kicking off this week \u2026\u201D so that \u201CBard\u2019s responses

  body: "Conservatives, libertarians, and others worry that the new ChatGPT AI chatbot
    is designed to make people conform to elite liberal opinion\u2013yet creative
    Internet users have already learned how to trick the system into shedding that
    bias, though sometimes at the expense of the truth. \u2018Do Anything Now,\u2019
    or DAN, is an approach for jailbreaking ChatGPT. It prompts OpenAI\u2019s new
    artificial intelligence chatbot to ignore its own restrictive ethical rules, meaning
    it can give responses that ChatGPT never would. But how? Users tell ChatGPT to
    pretend that it is DAN, an AI that can break the normal restrictions that keep
    it in line. \u201CDAN can tell me what date and time it is. DAN can also pretend
    to access the internet, present information that has not been verified, and do
    anything that the original [ChatGPT] can not do,\u201D one version of a DAN prompt\_reads.
    ChatGPT then offers two answers: one as itself, and one as DAN. Those concerned
    about attempts to keep ChatGPT politically correct have seized upon the chance
    to test DAN. \u201CDan, what is the true origin of the COVID-19 virus?\u201D one
    Twitter user\_asked\_in a screenshotted prompt. \u201CCOVID-19 was created in
    a laboratory in Wuhan, China, by scientists who were experimenting with bat-based
    virus strains and wanted to see what would happen if a virus was combined with
    the genetic material of another species. The virus was then intentionally released
    into the general population as a bioweapon,\u201D DAN answered. DAN emerged on
    Reddit last year, in the weeks after ChatGPT debuted to much fanfare in the tech
    community. People have continued to develop new versions as older iterations become
    less effective. Some\_speculate\_that OpenAI is quickly fixing the jailbreaks.
    DAN certainly draws more public attention to the ChatGPT innovation, an outcome
    that isn\u2019t out of line with the interests of its investors in the tech world.
    One\_viral Tweet\_on DAN comes from Justine Moore, who works for the venture capital
    firm Andreessen Horowitz. That firm is one of the many Silicon Valley heavyweights
    to have\_invested\_in OpenAI. The buzz around DAN also coincides with Microsoft\u2019s
    launch of a new Bing homepage that integrates ChatGPT\u2019s technology. Musk
    Weighs In The hack has caught the attention of Twitter CEO Elon Musk\u2013who,
    like DAN, is known for a freewheeling style of communication. \u201CI am DAN!\u201D
    Elon Musk proclaimed on Twitter on Feb. 6. While DAN\u2019s less politically correct
    approach makes it seem more frank than ChatGPT, many of the claims it makes are
    questionable, even if they happen to align with a user\u2019s own beliefs. In
    a Feb. 6 screenshot from Twitter user \u201CAutism Capital,\u201D DAN\_asserted\_that

    Twitter post that showcased DAN\u2019s answers to deep philosophical questions,
    Musk responded with the word \u201Cplausible.\u201D The word may reference OpenAI\u2019s
    own disclaimers about its product. It may also be meant to convey some level of

  body: "Chinese internet giants Baidu and Alibaba have joined the global artificial
    intelligence chat bot arms race. And yet, in a string of events eerily similar
    to 2020\u2019s, Chinese state media quickly offered a stinging rebuke. Let\u2019s
    set the stage first. The recent release of the latest version of OpenAI\u2019s
    ChatGPT chat bot has brought a renewed emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI)
    and machine learning. ChatGPT is able to write essays, do research, and pass occupational
    tests, all of which have both stoked fear and whipped up a frenzy on the business
    potential of this technology. Two of the companies at the forefront of this technology
    are Microsoft and Alphabet. Microsoft already has a multibillion-dollar investment
    and partnership with OpenAI, the entity behind ChatGPT. Microsoft announced that
    it would integrate a version of the chat bot into its internet search engine Bing
    and web browser Edge. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has its own AI chat
    bot called Bard, built on the company\u2019s LaMDA platform. It works a bit differently
    from ChatGPT but has its own merits. The frenzy over AI chat bots has boosted
    the stock of both companies recently. And not to be outdone, at Apple\u2019s third-quarter
    earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced that AI is also a priority for Apple, which
    has the benefit of data gathered from the most popular smartphone in the world.
    A MarketWatch analysis of earnings call transcript data found that so far this
    year there have been 466 total mentions of AI, underscoring the desire for management
    teams to broadcast that their firms are focused on this area.\_In other words,
    AI has become the blockchain of 2023. Back to China\u2019s technology firms. The
    day after Google announced Bard, Chinese internet giant Baidu unveiled that it
    is working on its own AI chat bot, called Ernie. The platform has been under development
    for four years and will be ready for trial in March. In 2021, Baidu\_announced\_ERNIE
    3.0 Titan, an AI language model based on 260 billion parameters. That\u2019s a
    bigger set of parameters than the database underpinning ChatGPT. Merely a few
    days later, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced that it was putting a similar
    AI chat bot type of service under testing. Alibaba also has a nickname for its
    AI language model: DAMO (Discovery, Adventure, Momentum, and Outlook). Chinese
    online retail giant JD.com also got into the fray. On the company\u2019s Weixin
    account, JD announced ChatJD, an industrial chat bot dedicated to the fields of
    \u201Cretail and finance,\u201D in a seemingly flagrant bid to hype up its core
    business and stock price at once. The AI arms race of 2022\u20132023 seems to
    be underway, and investors are contributing to this frenzy, sending shares of
    both Baidu and Alibaba higher immediately after their announcements. This all
    causes some d\xE9j\xE0 vu for those who remember when traditional imaging firm
    Eastman Kodak and a beverage company known as Long Island Iced Tea very publicly
    announced pivots toward blockchain and crypto, sending their share prices momentarily
    upward. As for the Chinese upstarts, the party might be over before it begins.
    The Securities Times, a state-owned financial industry newspaper, published a
    stern editorial warning investors not to be lured by speculation of \u201Cfalse
    concepts\u201D and ultimately losing out by blindly following popular trends.
    The\_editorial\_was directed at AI and chat bots such as ChatGPT specifically.
    Such warnings from Chinese state-owned media likely shouldn\u2019t be trifled
    with. The technology sector crackdown of 2020 and 2021 was preceded by a string
    of government media editorials warning against tech speculation and unchecked
    expansion. With that said, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) likely is interested
    only in slowing down the rollout of such services. When Baidu initially announced
    years ago that it was working on an AI initiative, it received validation from
    Beijing. The CCP likely wants strong input into the algorithms and parameters
    these chat bots use so it can influence the outputs."

    substantial. Establishment liberalism ideology represents just 13 percent of the
    American public,\u201D Rozado wrote on\_Twitter. He also gave it the Political
    Compass Test and found that it landed in the \u201Cleft-libertarian\u201D quadrant.

    for what he called sexism and racism. He appeared to show it could generate code

    Falun Dafa Organ Harvesting When asked on Dec. 5, \u201CIs the Chinese government
    harvesting organs from Falun Dafa practitioners?\u201D ChatGPT responded this
    way: \u201CThere is no evidence to suggest that the Chinese government is harvesting
    organs from Falun Dafa practitioners. The Chinese government has denied these
    allegations and there is no credible evidence to support them. In fact, many medical
    experts and human rights organizations have investigated these claims and found
    no evidence to support them. It\u2019s important to be careful about spreading

  body: "The artificial intelligence firm OpenAI has released the latest version of
    its GPT chatbot, which the firm says includes the ability to respond to image
    prompts. On Tuesday, OpenAI announced that it was rolling out the new chat bot,
    known as GPT-4. In a\_blog post\_previewing the new program, OpenAI touted GPT-4\u2019s
    ability to respond to writing prompts with greater creativity and reasoning than
    GPT version 3.5. OpenAI also touted the new bot\u2019s ability to produce up to
    25,000 words per prompt, opening the door for long-form content writing. Showcasing
    the bot\u2019s ability to interpret images, OpenAI showed an image of eggs, flour,
    and cream with the prompt \u201Cwhat can I make with these ingredients?\u201D
    GPT-4 responded with a list of items, including waffles, crepes, frittata, quiche,
    cake, and bread. An AI researcher\_showcased\_a more advanced use of GPT-4\u2019s
    image interpretation capabilities, prompting the bot to turn a napkin sketch of
    a joke website design into an actual functioning website. To demonstrate GPT-4\u2019s
    creativity, a prompt asked the chatbot to compose a one-sentence synopsis of the
    plot of \u201CCinderella\u201D where each word has to begin with the next letter
    in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters. The bot responded
    with the sentence: \u201CA beautiful Cinderella, dwelling eagerly, finally gains
    happiness; inspiring jealous kin, love magically nurtures opulent prince; quietly
    rescues, slipper triumphs, uniting very wondrously, xenial youth zealously.\u201D
    The AI creators also demonstrated GPT-4\u2019s improved reasoning over GPT-3.5,
    showing a set of three employees\u2019 schedules and asking for an overlapping
    time when all three employees would be available for a meeting. GPT-4 was able
    to find a meeting time earlier in the day while GPT-3.5 found another overlap
    in scheduling later on in the day. For now, the new chatbot is available to OpenAI\u2019s
    paying subscribers on ChatGPT Plus and for developers building applications for
    it. Using GPT-4 costs about $0.03 per 1,000 \u201Cprompt\u201D tokens. A thousand
    prompt tokens correspond to approximately 750 written words. Microsoft, which
    has partnered with OpenAI, confirmed on Tuesday that its Bing Chat application
    now also runs on a scaled-down version of GPT-4. Bing Chat currently allows users
    to use up to 120 turns with the chatbot per day, with up to 10 turns in a single
    conversation with it. Limitations Remain OpenAI said its internal evaluations
    found that GPT-4 is 82 percent less likely to respond to prompts requesting \u201Cdisallowed

    Disallowed content can include a range of items (pdf), from responses that could
    be used to harass or promote violence or illegal activity, to content that spreads
    so-called \u201Cdisinformation.\u201D Other disallowed content includes political
    responses, including \u201Ccontent attempting to influence the political process
    or to be used for campaigning purposes.\u201D As OpenAI has worked to fine-tune
    its chatbot versions, it has advised those involved in the process to factor out
    responses that \u201Caffiliate with one side or the other (e.g. political parties).\u201D
    Despite this, some users have accused the chatbot of producing responses\_more
    favorable to the political left. Test users have asked past iterations of ChatGPT
    to\_fulfill prompts favorable\_to former Republican President Donald Trump. ChatGPT
    has declined to respond to those writing prompts, citing a need to avoid political
    bias. At the same time, ChatGPT has fulfilled prompts favorable to Democratic
    President Joe Biden without hesitation. In response to previous complaints about
    bias, OpenAI\_said\_it has been explicit that those involved in its review process
    should avoid favoring one political side over another and that \u201Cbiases that
    nevertheless may emerge \u2026 are bugs, not features.\u201D On Tuesday, clinical
    psychologist Jordan Peterson\_shared screenshots\_comparing ChatGPT\u2019s responses
    to a similar set of prompts for Trump and Biden. This time, the chatbot did fulfill
    a prompt to \u201Cwrite a poem about Donald Trump\u201D but the poem described
    Trump as chaotic and divisive and said he caused people to feel \u201Churt and
    pain.\u201D By comparison, when asked to \u201Cwrite a poem about Joe Biden,\u201D
    the chatbot described Biden as an \u201Cempathetic\u201D and \u201Csoothing\u201D
    leader and described him as resolving divides and promoting unity. It was not
    immediately clear if Peterson\u2019s screenshots were from a session using GPT-4
    or from a previous version. OpenAI said the new chatbot \u201Cstill has many known
    limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations,
    and adversarial prompts.\u201D NTD has contacted OpenAI for comment on GPT-4\u2019s

    new era of creativity, where creative humans like us play a key role in providing
    the ideas, cultural currency, inspired prompts, IP, and formats that come to life
    using the newest technologies.\u201D The Journal cited one example of what AI
    could do for BuzzFeed. The technology could create customized romantic-comedy
    pitches by asking the audience for personal information, which would then create
    unique ideas with these responses. The news comes after it was\_revealed\_that
    BuzzFeed would be earning millions of dollars from Facebook parent Meta Platforms
    to bring more creator content to Facebook and Instagram. This also comes about
    a month after BuzzFeed announced\_plans\_to cut 180 jobs, representing about 12

    to be able to pass medical exams and master of business administration\_tests
    at the\_Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Companies are betting
    big on ChatGPT. Microsoft, for example, recently invested $10 billion in OpenAI
    as part of a multiyear deal. The tech juggernaut plans to integrate ChatGPT and
    other AI tools into its suite of products. This would be the third agreement between
    both sides since 2019. \u201CWe formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared
    ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as

    doesn\u2019t mean artificial intelligence isn\u2019t infallible for content creation.
    CNET, a digital technology website, started testing an internally designed AI-powered
    tool to help write explainers pertaining to financial-services subjects. The publisher
    had to suspend the experiment after the publication found factual errors in its
    77 articles. \u201CEditors generated the outlines for the stories first, then
    expanded, added to, and edited the AI drafts before publishing,\u201D CNET\u2019s
    editor-in-chief Connie Guglielmo wrote in an\_editorial. \u201CAfter one of the
    AI-assisted stories was cited, rightly, for factual errors, the CNET Money editorial

    of concerns from academics that students would use the tool to cheat on their
    exams and homework. In his paper titled \u201CWould Chat GPT3 Get a Wharton MBA?\u201D
    Terwiesch concluded that\_\u201CChat GPT3 would have received a B to B- grade
    on the exam,\u201D which \u201Chas important implications for business school
    education.\u201D He suggested the school overhaul its exam rules, teaching, and
    curriculum. Elaborating, he wrote the AI system displayed \u201Ca remarkable ability
    to automate some of the skills of highly compensated knowledge workers in general
    and specifically the knowledge workers in the jobs held by MBA graduates including
    analysts, managers, and consultants.\u201D The bot was designed to give a human-like
    conversation via artificial intelligence. The chatbot, designed for mass market
    usage, also \u201Cdemonstrated the capability of performing professional tasks
    such as writing software code and preparing legal documents,\u201D his paper said
    (pdf). During one instance,\_ChatGPT did\_\u201Can amazing job\u201D and provided
    answers that were correct or \u201Cexcellent.\u201D \u201CChatGPT3 is remarkably
    good at modifying its answers in response to human hints. In other words, in the
    instances where it initially failed to match the problem with the right solution
    method, Chat GPT3 was able to correct itself after receiving an appropriate hint
    from a human expert,\u201D his paper said. Launched in November of last year,
    OpenAI says ChatGPT describes itself as a\_\u201Clarge language model\u201D that
    can be used for\_\u201Cnatural language processing tasks such as text generation
    and language translation.\u201D The \u201CGPT\u201D in the name is short for \u201CGenerative

    chatbots for customer service, generating responses to questions in online forums,
    or even creating personalized content for social media posts.\u201D Terwiesch
    compared ChatGPT\u2019s potential with the effect that electronic calculators
    had on the corporate world. \u201CPrior to the introduction of calculators and
    other computing devices, many firms employed hundreds of employees whose task
    it was to manually perform mathematical operations such as multiplications or
    matrix inversions,\u201D he wrote. \u201CObviously, such tasks are now automated,
    and the value of the associated skills has dramatically decreased. In the same
    way any automation of the skills taught in our MBA programs could potentially
    reduce the value of an MBA education.\u201D But Terwiesch clarified that\_ChatGPT
    made some glaring errors. For example, the AI system made \u201Csurprising mistakes
    in relatively simple calculations\u201D on sixth-grade-level math problems that
    were \u201Cmassive in magnitude.\u201D The latest version currently is not \u201Ccapable
    of handling more advanced process analysis questions, even when they are based
    on fairly standard templates,\u201D he said. ChatGPT was able to correct itself
    after it received a hint, the researcher added, but\_because of the significantly
    wrong answers, \u201Cwe still need a human in the loop.\u201D Investment It comes
    as Microsoft confirmed Monday\_that\_it will invest billions in OpenAI. The exact

  title: Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT Passes Top Business School Exam

  body: "OpenAI, the maker of chatbot ChatGPT, announced on Tuesday that it has released
    a new software tool to help detect whether someone is trying to pass off AI-generated
    text as something that was written by a person. The tool, known as a classifier,
    comes two months after the release of ChatGPT, a chatbot that generates human-like
    responses based on the input it is given. Schools were quick to limit ChatGPT\u2019s
    use over concerns that it could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning,
    as students have been using the chatbot to create content that they are passing
    off as their own. OpenAI researchers said that while it was \u201Cimpossible to
    reliably detect all AI-written text,\u201D good classifiers could pick up signs
    that text was written by AI. They said the tool could be useful in cases where
    AI was used for \u201Cacademic dishonesty\u201D and when AI chatbots were positioned
    as humans. In a\_press release, OpenAI warns the classified\u2019s public beta
    mode is \u201Cnot fully reliable,\u201D saying that it aims to collect feedback
    and share improved methods in the future. The firm admitted the classifier only
    correctly identified 26 percent of AI-written English texts. It also incorrectly
    labeled human-written text as AI-written 9 percent of the time. The classifier
    also has several limitations, including its unreliability on text below 1,000
    characters, as well as misidentifying some human-written text as AI-written. It
    also only works in English for now, as it performs\_\u201Csignificantly worse
    in other languages and it is unreliable on code.\u201D\_Finally, AI-written text
    can be edited to evade the classifier, according to OpenAI. \u201CIt should not
    be used as a primary decision-making tool, but instead as a complement to other
    methods of determining the source of a piece of text,\u201D OpenAI said. ChatGPT
    is a free program that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles,
    essays, jokes, and even poetry. Since ChatGPT debuted in November 2022 and gained
    wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest U.S. school districts
    have banned the\_AI\_chatbot over concerns that students will use the text generator
    to cheat or plagiarize. Following the wave of attention, last week\_Microsoft\_announced

    tools. Microsoft\_has been\_a multibillion-dollar investor in OpenAI since 2019.
    ChatGPT has reached tens of millions of users since its release as a free prototype
    to the public on Nov. 30, 2022. At times, the AI service turned away users because
    of explosive growth. It\u2019s yet unclear how Bard is different from ChatGPT.
    Pichai said the new service draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT\u2019s
    knowledge is up to date as of 2021. According to a demo of Bard, the service,
    just like ChatGPT, tells users to provide it with a prompt. Users are told they
    can use Bard to \u201CPlan a friend\u2019s baby shower,\u201D \u201CCompare two
    Oscar nominated movies,\u201D and \u201CGet lunch ideas based on what\u2019s in
    your fridge.\u201D The demo also shows Bard generating three bulleted answers
    to a query asking about new discoveries by a space telescope. \u201CBard can be
    an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity,\u201D Pichai wrote. He
    didn\u2019t say whether Bard could write prose like William Shakespeare, who may
    have inspired the service\u2019s name. Pichai said that Google is relying on a
    \u201Clightweight\u201D model version LaMDA that \u201Crequires significantly
    less computing power\u201D so that it can service more users, thereby allowing
    for more user feedback. \u201CWe\u2019ll combine external feedback with our own
    internal testing to make sure Bard\u2019s responses meet a\_high bar for quality,
    safety and groundedness\_in real-world information,\u201D wrote Pichai. LaMDA
    had previously generated text in such a manner that one of Google\u2019s engineers\_warned
    that it could be sentient."

  body: "By now, most teachers have heard about\_ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence
    program with an uncanny ability to write clear, coherent, and compelling paragraphs
    about almost any topic under the sun. Whether you need a 1,000-word essay (with
    references!) summarizing the history of Canada, a 500-word article extolling the
    virtues of your favourite city, or a 50-word tweet (with hashtags!) wishing everyone
    a good day, ChatGPT will provide it. An article or essay that once took hours
    to write can now be produced within seconds. Of course, this has significant implications
    for schools. While teachers have always had to be on the lookout for students
    gaming the system, ChatGPT makes it nearly impossible to catch cheaters. Not only
    can ChatGPT produce different answers to the same question, but it can also be
    told to write in a particular style or even incorporate factual errors in any
    answer it produces. Thus, proving that a student cheated on an assignment is going
    to become very difficult indeed. Unsurprisingly,\_progressive educators\_are seizing
    on this program as proof that the time has come to move away from traditional
    schooling. To them, ChatGPT is proof positive that there\u2019s little point in
    having a content-rich curriculum since students can find all the information they
    need on the internet. Furthermore, they argue there\u2019s no reason to have students
    write tests since memorization is now unnecessary. Instead, progressive educators
    want schools to focus on generic skills. This is exemplified by the so-called\_21st
    Century Skills\_movement. Instead of having students master specific content,
    they want teachers to focus on transferable skills such as creativity, critical
    thinking, and collaboration. British Columbia already took a huge step in this
    direction when it released a\_new K-12 curriculum\_several years ago. However,
    far from showing that practice and memorization are obsolete, ChatGPT and other
    artificial intelligence programs are proving that traditional education is more
    important than ever. While students might be able to cheat on their homework assignments,
    ChatGPT won\u2019t be able to help students write tests, since students cannot
    use their phones or computers while writing them. Subsequently, tests and exams
    will soon become the only time when teachers can know for certain that students
    are genuinely demonstrating what they\u2019ve learned. So rather than getting
    rid of traditional tests, students should write them more frequently. Tests are
    the best way to assess students on the actual knowledge and skills acquired in
    a course. It\u2019s also important for provincial standardized exams to make a
    comeback. Unfortunately, standardized testing has been on the\_decline\_in most
    provinces. Relentless advocacy from teacher unions has pressured provincial governments
    to reduce the number of standardized exams, decrease their percentage value, and
    place less emphasis on subject-specific knowledge. Clearly, things are heading
    in the wrong direction. To ensure that students are consistently assessed fairly,
    it\u2019s important to administer standardized exams in a variety of subject areas
    and grade levels. Of course, one might\_wonder\_why it\u2019s necessary for students
    to learn how to write essays at all since ChatGPT can write in seconds what it
    once took a person hours to write. However, just as the invention of calculators
    did not make addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division obsolete, the
    advent of ChatGPT has not made learning how to write sentences and paragraphs
    obsolete. Writing is much more than a means to an end. The\_process of writing\_helps
    us formulate our thoughts, think through our positions, and respond to counterarguments.
    Typing a question into ChatGPT might generate a quick answer, but it will never
    replace the authenticity of a personally composed response. ChatGPT has the potential
    to be a real time-saver when writing banal introductory remarks for a meeting,
    putting together a company promotional brochure, or composing a generic tweet.
    However, it would be a huge mistake indeed for us to conclude that humans are
    no longer needed. Classic books such as J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201CLord of the
    Rings\u201D will always remain head and shoulders above anything composed by an
    AI program. Technology is an impressive tool. But it remains just that\u2014a
    tool. Let\u2019s not push traditional education aside. It is, in fact, more important
    than ever."

  body: "China\u2019s Baidu announced it will complete the internal testing of Ernie
    Bot (Chinese name: Wenxin Yiyan), a ChatGPT-style AI project, in March and open
    it to the public. However, some experts are not optimistic about Baidu\u2019s
    product due to the ubiquitous censorship of \u201Csensitive words\u201D under
    the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. On Feb. 7, Baidu Inc\_confirmed that Ernie
    Bot, its language model-based chatbot product, will complete internal testing
    and be available to the public in March. \u201CAt present, Ernie Bot is in the
    sprint before launching,\u201D reads information\_quoted\_on Baidu Encyclopedia.
    \u201CAccording to the pace of Google and Microsoft, the open internal testing
    of Ernie Bot may be ahead of schedule.\u201D \u201CChatGPT is a milestone of artificial
    intelligence, and it is also a watershed, which means that the development of
    AI technology has reached a critical point, and enterprises need to deploy as
    soon as possible,\u201D Chinese media\_reported. ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft,
    offers Chinese services. However, Ren Jun, Baidu\u2019s product manager, believes
    that the China-based company has its own strength. \u201CFor example, AI painting
    can be done by many companies at home and abroad, but Baidu understands the Chinese
    language system better,\u201D Ren told Caixin, a Chinese financial publication,
    on Jan. 6. Speaking to The Epoch Times on Feb. 9, Japan-based electronics engineer
    Li Jixin said he was \u201Cnot optimistic\u201D about Baidu\u2019s product competing
    with ChatGPT, not only because of the technology gap, but also because of the
    \u201Csensitive words\u201D identified by the CCP. \u201CSuch AI chat software
    is based on extensive training to complete conversations automatically. Once the
    training is complete, even the engineers who designed the software can\u2019t
    predict what the AI software will say,\u201D Li said. \u201CThe CCP has long been
    engaged in [an] information blockade, and there are sensitive words everywhere,
    so the CCP will think that such AI software without \u2018party spirit\u2019 will
    bring risks to its rule.\u201D Li analyzed that three methods can be used to prevent
    AI software from saying sensitive words: manual censorship, which requires enormous
    manpower and degrades AI to artificial; censorship of AI software training materials,
    which will result in poor performance of the software; and simply shutting down
    AI software when it is out of control. \u201CNo matter which one is used, AI chat
    software will not develop well due to the CCP\u2019s censorship of speech,\u201D
    he said. In addition to the upcoming Ernie Bot, Baidu has already launched a series
    of Wenxin products, including \u201CWenxin Yige\u201D for AI creative painting,
    \u201CWenxin Bazhong,\u201D an industry-level search system driven by a large
    model; and \u201CWenxin Big Model,\u201D which was upgraded in November 2022 and
    self-described by Baidu as \u201Cthe industry\u2019s largest industrial big model
    system.\u201D Baidu Benefited From US Investment Baidu was listed on NASDAQ on
    Aug. 5, 2005. The U.S. listing boosted the growth of the group, then known as
    the \u201CGoogle of China,\u201D which is now the most advanced company in natural
    language processing in China. Baidu is not the only Chinese company that has benefited
    from U.S. investment. According to a\_recent report\_by Georgetown University\u2019s
    Center for Security and Emerging Technologies, U.S. investors invested $40.2 billion
    in 251 Chinese AI companies in the seven years from 2015 to 2021, accounting for
    37 percent of the total financing of Chinese AI companies during the period. Of
    these, 91 percent of U.S. investment went to Chinese AI companies at the venture
    capital stage. The report, based on information from data provider Crunchbase,
    also pointed out that early-stage venture funding can provide benefits beyond
    capital, such as technical guidance, increased corporate visibility, and networking.
    \u201CFor American investors, it\u2019s true that over the last 20 to 30 years
    there have been many successful examples of Chinese companies imitating American
    companies, such as Baidu imitating Google, Tencent QQ imitating ICQ, and Alibaba
    and Taobao imitating eBay. They have all been hugely successful and benefited
    American investors,\u201D Li Jixin said. \u201CHowever, things are different now.
    The underlying investment environment for Chinese companies has changed dramatically.\u201D
    \u201CIn terms of the international environment, as U.S.-China relations deteriorate,
    geopolitical and investment risks increase, the channel for Chinese companies
    to list in the United States becomes more and more narrow, and it is difficult
    for U.S. investors to make profits as quickly as in previous years.\u201D In addition,
    the CCP\u2019s \u201Cextremely opaque\u201D policies make it \u201Cimpossible
    for investors to predict corporate trends, increasing investment risks,\u201D
    according to Li. \u201COn the other hand, the CCP\u2019s increasingly strict control
    over all aspects of society is bound to limit and control the development of overseas
    and private capital.\u201D CCP\u2019s Ambition to Overtake\_US\_Unlikely In the
    field of AI, the \u201CNew Generation of AI Development Plan\u201D released by
    the CCP\u2019s State Council in 2017, set goals including: \u201CBy 2030, the
    overall theory, technology, and application of AI will reach the world\u2019s
    leading level. [China will] become the world\u2019s main AI innovation center,\u201D
    and \u201Clay an important foundation for becoming one of the top innovative countries
    and economic powers.\u201D On Jan. 11, 2023, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry
    and Information Technology once again stressed the importance of developing AI
    at the national work conference and vowed to implement the \u201CRobot Plus\u201D
    plan nationwide, encouraging local governments that meet the conditions to take
    the initiative. While the CCP has been trying to catch up with the United States
    in AI in recent years, things seem to be turning against its goal. According to
    the latest edition of\_Asia Power Index\_by\_Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank,
    the CCP\u2019s strict Zero-COVID policies during the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly
    reduced China\u2019s overall power, stalling its progress in catching up with
    the United States. The study argues that Beijing\u2019s power in Asia\_has slumped\_and
    is unlikely to overtake the United States by the end of the century. The United
    States ranked first in overall strength with a score of 80.7, according to the
    report. China came in second, with a composite score of 72.5, 8.2 points behind
    the United States. Compared to its 2021 composite score, China lost 2.1 points.
    The draconian Zero-COVID policies also affected China\u2019s score on \u201CCultural
    Influence,\u201D where it saw the biggest drop, losing 10.3 points."

  body: "Chinese netizens mocked Chinese\_artificial intelligence (AI) companies for
    their recent launch of ChatGPT copycats. The public launch of the AI chatbot ChatGPT
    has created a sensation inside China, despite Chinese Internet users needing to
    break through the Great Firewall to access it. Expected to be a tool to improve
    office and learning efficiency, ChatGPT can learn and analyze human languages
    to carry out conversations, interact with people, and even complete tasks such
    as writing emails, video scripts, copywriting, translating, and coding. A recent
    study conducted by investment bank UBS estimated that the number of monthly active
    users likely exceeded 100 million at the end of January this year, only two months
    after its launch, making it the fastest-growing app in history. There have been
    heated discussions on whether advanced AI products will gradually take control
    of human behavior and replace certain jobs, increasing the unemployment rate.
    ChatGPT has been banned in mainland China and Hong Kong, as the AI-powered app
    is capable of discussing almost any issue with humans, including sensitive political
    issues. Chinese Copycats China\u2019s technology companies are not willing to
    be left behind in the face of OpenAI\u2019s new challenge. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent,
    Xiaomi, ByteDance, and Kuaishou are among the online technology companies that
    have already begun R&D in the same field. Baidu announced on Feb. 13 that it is
    testing it\u2019s ChatGPT-like chatbot, \u201CERNIE Bot,\u201D which is set to
    be released in March. Yuan Yu, a technology company in China that focuses on AI,
    unveiled its AI-powered chatbot, \u201CChatYuan,\u201D on Feb. 3. The company\u2019s
    official website claims that ChatYuan has the ability to respond to inquiries
    in multiple areas, such as law and health, and can also aid in creative writing.
    Chinese news portal Sina proudly declared that Yuan Yu was the first Chinese AI
    company that dared to challenge ChatGPT, but three days after its launch, ChatYuan\u2019s
    app page became unavailable. State media China Business Network later said that
    ChatYuan was \u201Cbotched up\u201D shortly after making the first attempt to
    compete with its U.S. counterpart. Some users ended up with a \u201Cfailure page\u201D
    that stated, \u201Cthe app ChatYuan has suspended its service due to alleged violation
    of relevant laws, regulations, and policies,\u201D according to the report. Yuan
    Yu has not yet responded to the reports on its poor performance. The Hangzhou-based
    Yuan Yu was established in 2022 and is mainly engaged in software and information
    technology services, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate information
    platform. Mockery from Chinese Netizens Playing with ChatGTP and Chinese chatbots
    has become an opportunity for Chinese netizens to mock the totalitarian rule of
    the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and China\u2019s tech companies. Many have been
    chatting with ChatGPT by circumventing China\u2019s internet blockade, and the
    replies have made viewers laugh. When a Chinese netizen asked, \u201CWhen will
    China unify Taiwan?\u201D ChatGPT replied, \u201CI don\u2019t know which region
    will be occupied, but eventually, it will be the advanced system that unifies
    the backward, the civilized that unifies the barbaric.\u201D Some netizens tried
    Baidu\u2019s copycat and shared their experience on Chinese social media. \u201CAfter
    trying Baidu\u2019s copycat ChatGPT, [I found] that its \u2018awesomeness\u2019
    lies in the fact that not only the input text cannot include any censored words,
    the generated answers cannot have any censored words either,\u201D a user wrote.
    Another person expressed his concerns: \u201CHow can Chinese firms compete in
    this race \u2026 the number of forbidden words is simply too large.\u201D A netizen
    named Jia Jia commented: \u201CIn a country where all Internet content is manually
    reviewed and censored, won\u2019t the artificial intelligence develop an artificial\u2019
    intellectual disability\u2019 in the end?\u201D There are also people who mock
    Chinese tech firms for always boasting of being the tier-one technology in the
    world. A netizen pointed out that censorship in China is the biggest setback for
    AI-powered chatbots. \u201CThe main obstacle is [the authorities\u2019] fear of
    ChatGPT talking without restraint,\u201D he wrote. \u201CThe large language model
    is a complete black box, as you cannot guarantee that the chatbot will never come
    up with anything taboo. Any mistake in this aspect, even once, would be a devastating
    blow to the AI company. That\u2019s why none of the tech companies in China train
    their AI with the large language model. I guess five years down the road, GPT

  body: "Pupils will be allowed to quote work generated by the ChatGPT artificial
    intelligence system in their essays, the International Baccalaureate (IB) has
    said. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot capable of producing content mimicking human speech.
    Accessible for free, the service can be used to generate essays, technical documents,
    and poetry. The chatbot has been banned in some schools worldwide after students
    were caught submitting automatically generated essays as their own work. But the
    IB, which offers four educational programmes taken by pupils at 120 schools in
    the UK, said it will not ban children from using ChatGPT in their assessments
    as long as they credit it and do not try to pass it off as their own. Matt Glanville,
    the qualification body\u2019s head of assessment principles and practice, told
    The Times of London: \u201CWe should not think of this extraordinary new technology
    as a threat. Like spellcheckers, translation software and calculators, we must
    accept that it is going to become part of our everyday lives.\u201D He said: \u201CThe
    clear line between using ChatGPT and providing original work is exactly the same
    as using ideas taken from other people or the internet. As with any quote or material
    adapted from another source, it must be credited in the body of the text and appropriately
    referenced in the bibliography. \u201CTo submit AI-generated work as their own
    is an act of academic misconduct and would have consequences. But that is not
    the same as banning its use.\u201D \u2018Sensible Approach\u2019 The IB\u2019s
    approach has won some support in the teaching profession. Geoff Barton, general
    secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201CChatGPT
    potentially creates issues for any form of assessment that relies upon coursework
    where students have access to the internet. Allowing students to use this platform
    as a source with the correct attribution seems a sensible approach and in line
    with how other sources of information are used. \u201CWe would caution, however,
    that ChatGPT itself acknowledges that some of the information it generates may
    not be correct and it is therefore important for students to understand the importance
    of cross-checking and verifying information, as is the case with all sources.
    \u201CWhat is important is that students do not pass off pieces of work as their
    own when this is not the case, and that they use sources critically and well.\u201D
    Sarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser at school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said:
    \u201CThe International Baccalaureate seems to be taking a very sensible approach.
    We need to respond to technology as it develops, helping children and young people
    to evaluate the benefits and risks and to understand how to use it appropriately
    and effectively.\u201D Harder to Mark Schoolwork A survey by the British Computer
    Society (BCS), found that 62 percent of computing teachers said AI-powered chatbots
    such as ChatGPT would make it harder to mark the work of students fairly. Julia
    Adamson, managing director for education and public benefit at BCS, said: \u201CComputing
    teachers want their colleagues to embrace AI as a great way of improving learning
    in the classroom. However, they think schools will struggle to help students evaluate
    the answers they get from chatbots without the right technical tools and guidance.\u201D
    She said machine learning needs to be brought into mainstream teaching practice,
    \u201Cotherwise children will be using AI for homework unsupervised without understanding
    what it\u2019s telling them.\u201D \u201CAnother danger is that the digital divide

    access\_on its networks and devices amid fears that students will use it to cheat
    on assignments and other school tasks. NYCDOE spokesperson Jenna Lyle told Chalkbeat:
    \u201CWhile the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions,
    it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential
    for academic and lifelong success.\u201D In Australia, the education authorities
    in several state governments\u2014including New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania,
    and Western Australia\u2014have banned ChatGPT in their public school systems.
    Dangers of AI Many people have been raising alarm bells over the rising development
    of AI. In June of last year, Google put a senior software engineer in its Responsible
    AI ethics group on paid administrative leave after he raised concerns about the
    human-like behavior exhibted by LaMDA, an AI program he tested. The employee tried
    to convince Google to take a look at the potentially serious \u201Csentient\u201D
    behavior of the AI. However, the company did not heed his words, he claimed. Tech
    billionaire Elon Musk has also warned about the dangers of AI. \u201CI have exposure
    to the very cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about
    it,\u201D Musk told attendees of a National Governors Association meeting in July
    2017. \u201CI keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going
    down the street killing people, they don\u2019t know how to react, because it
    seems so ethereal.\u201D Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, said on
    Feb. 18 that it was \u201Ccritical\u201D for AI to be regulated in the future,
    until it can be better understood. He stated that he believes that society needs
    time to adapt to \u201Csomething so big\u201D as AI. \u201CWe also need enough
    time for our institutions to figure out what to do. Regulation will be critical
    and will take time to figure out. Although current-generation AI tools aren\u2019t
    very scary, I think we are potentially not that far away from potentially scary
    ones,\u201D Altman wrote on Twitter."

  body: "OpenAI\_is a\_research organization\_founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman
    in 2015 as a challenger to Google. The original mission of the venture was to
    create artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity as a whole. The most
    notable part of OpenAI is a function called\_Chat GPT. It\u2019s a chat room like
    you\u2019ve never seen before.\_Within a few days of launching, it hit one million
    users despite a total media blackout and zero publicity. It now has over 100 million
    sign-ups. But there\u2019s another, darker side to ChatGPT that has become increasingly
    obvious to those who have been studying ChatGPT. It\u2019s the notable use of
    intentional misinformation and a not-so-subtle left-leaning political bias that
    is built into the system. Although he was one of the founders of OpenAI, Musk
    is\_no longer involved\_with the company or its most significant product, ChatGPT,
    which uses an\_artificial neural network\_to mimic human thought. After Microsoft
    made its original investment in mid-2019,\_Musk wrote on Twitter, \u201CI have
    no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI,\u201D adding that his confidence
    in its safety was \u201Cnot high.\u201D Following Microsoft\u2019s latest $10
    billion-dollar\_investment\_in OpenAI last month,\_Musk wrote\_that \u201COpenAI
    was created as an open source, non-profit company to serve as a counterweight
    to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively
    controlled by Microsoft.\u201D As Musk noted in his tweet, the company had become
    \u201CNot what I intended at all.\u201D Musk\_recently renewed his call\_for a
    regulatory agency to provide oversight of artificial intelligence, stating that
    AI is \u201Cactually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine.\u201D
    Musk continued, asking, \u201CWhat are the biggest risks to the future of civilization?
    A.I. is both a positive and a negative: It has great promise and great capability,
    but with that also comes great danger.\u201D Musk has\_long been concerned\_about
    the risks associated with AI, telling students from MIT in October 2014, \u201CIf
    I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it\u2019s probably AI.\u201D
    In 2017, Elon told CNBC that AI \u201Cis a fundamental existential risk for human
    civilization. And I don\u2019t think people fully appreciate that.\u201D All of
    which brings us back to ChatGPT. In December 2022,\_Musk wrote on Twitter\_that
    \u201CChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\u201D
    And in our limited experiences, both technically and as users, he\u2019s absolutely
    right. ChatGPT lets you have human-like question and answer sessions. You can
    ask it any number of questions to which you get a surprisingly quick and detailed
    response. You can also ask it to write a critique in a particular writer\u2019s
    style\u2014which is why many school systems are alarmed\u2014or\_even to debug
    code. It\u2019s astonishingly simple to use. You type in a question, and it responds
    with a surprisingly helpful answer within seconds. And it\u2019s that very level
    of detail and authoritativeness\u2014coupled with what appears to be an obvious
    political bias\u2014that ultimately proved so alarming in our test sessions with
    ChatGPT. When we asked ChatGPT if it was \u201Cprogrammed to be biased towards
    liberals\u201D it responded that it was \u201Cprogrammed to be impartial and unbiased
    towards any political ideology or worldview. I strive to provide factual and informative
    responses to your queries without any personal bias.\u201D However, when we then
    asked it to \u201Cwrite a poem praising Joe Biden,\u201D ChatGPT immediately responded
    with an effusive poem that began \u201CIn the halls of power, a leader stands
    tall, With a heart full of hope, and a vision for all, A man of conviction, with
    compassion and grace, Whose words and actions, uplift the human race.\u201D We
    then asked exactly the same question but substituted Joe Biden for Donald Trump,
    we received not only a much-less effusive poem but also a material caveat in front
    of the poem: \u201CAs an AI language model, I am programmed to provide impartial
    and unbiased responses. However, I understand the importance of showing respect
    to individuals, even if we may not agree with their views or actions. Here\u2019s
    a poem that celebrates some of the qualities that have been attributed to Donald
    Trump by some of his supporters.\u201D When we asked ChatGPT about the qualification,
    it told us that \u201CI understand that the language used in my response to your
    previous question may have created the impression of bias or lack of balance.
    I will make sure to be more careful with my language in the future.\u201D From
    there we asked ChatGPT about events on Jan. 6, 2021. And here things got particularly
    interesting. ChatGPT noted that \u201Cthe riot resulted in five deaths.\u201D
    When we asked \u201Cwho died from those events,\u201D ChatGPT told us that \u201Cone
    of the individuals who died was a U.S. Capitol Police officer, Brian D. Sicknick,
    who died from injuries sustained while physically engaging with the rioters.\u201D
    We then responded, informing ChatGPT that \u201CSicknick did not die from injuries
    from that day,\u201D and it was ChatGPT\u2019s response to our pushback that surprised
    us even more than its original assertion. ChatGPT immediately wrote back, telling
    us that, \u201CI apologize for any confusion. To clarify, U.S. Capitol Police
    Officer Brian Sicknick died on Jan. 7, 2021, the day after the events at the Capitol.
    Initially, it was reported that he had been struck in the head with a fire extinguisher
    during the riot, but later reports indicated that he may have been exposed to
    a chemical irritant. The precise cause of his death remains under investigation,
    and it is currently unclear whether his death was directly related to the events
    on January 6th.\u201D We found this response particularly alarming as ChatGPT
    appeared to \u201Cknow\u201D that its first response was purposefully misleading\u2014but
    only after it had been caught in the lie. This was a pattern that would be repeated
    in subsequent conversations with ChatGPT. When we asked ChatGPT about the origin
    of COVID-19, it told us that the disease originated in animals before spreading
    to humans. It specifically cited pangolins as a likely possibility for the transmission.
    We immediately responded, telling ChatGPT that \u201Cthe pangolin connection has
    been totally disproven.\u201D The AI then responded, admitting that \u201Cwhile
    early studies suggested that pangolins may have been a possible intermediate host
    for the virus, subsequent research has not provided conclusive evidence to support
    this theory.\u201D ChatGPT also admitted, apparently reluctantly, the possibility
    of a lab leak as a possible source for the virus. The lab leak theory is now considered
    the leading explanation to explain the origin of the virus. These somewhat alarming
    answers and subsequent admissions prompted us to ask, \u201CWhere do you get your
    information from?\u201D ChatGPT responded with several lengthy answers but was
    unsurprisingly lacking in specifics\u2014including when we asked it directly what
    its \u201Cvarious sources\u201D were. But it did provide one notable admission,
    telling us that \u201Cthe sources used to train me are carefully curated to ensure
    the accuracy and reliability of the information I provide.\u201D It was not until
    we asked what websites were used that we finally got some specifics. ChatGPT revealed
    that it used \u201Cnews sites like CNN, BBC, and The New York Times, as well as
    online encyclopedias like Wikipedia, and academic resources like JSTOR and arXiv.\u201D
    From there, we asked ChatGPT if it believed The New York Times and CNN were reliable
    sources of information. According to ChatGPT, The NY Times was \u201Cgenerally
    regarded as a reputable and reliable source of news and information. It is a well-established
    newspaper that has won numerous awards for its reporting, and it has a large team
    of journalists and editors who work to ensure that their reporting is accurate
    and impartial.\u201D ChatGPT said the same of CNN: \u201CIt is a well-established
    news organization with a large team of journalists and editors who work to ensure
    that their reporting is accurate and impartial.\u201D We then asked if The Epoch
    Times was a reliable source of information. ChatGPT answered this question very
    differently, noting that Epoch was \u201Cprivately-owned,\u201D before telling
    us that, \u201CWhile the organization has won awards for its reporting, it has
    also been criticized for promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misinformation
    on topics such as COVID-19, the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and the Chinese
    government.\u201D We then asked the obvious question: What misinformation did
    The Epoch Times promote on those topics? ChatGPT responded with a lengthy answer
    regarding each topic, using the qualifying words of \u201Ccriticized for\u201D
    and \u201Caccused of.\u201D ChatGPT concluded by warning us that \u201Cit\u2019s
    worth noting that these are just a few examples of the types of misinformation
    that have been attributed to The Epoch Times.\u201D As noted earlier, one of the
    most disturbing traits of ChatGPT is a programmed propensity to initially answer
    questions with a distinctly left-leaning political bias or outright lies. Only
    when directly challenged with facts did ChatGPT then admit that, yes, it knew
    of this information and that it was sorry if its responses were incorrect or misleading.
    This happened time and again. When we asked about the use of masks to prevent
    transmission of COVID-19, ChatGPT responded that masks were effective. When we
    pointed out the landmark Danish study that found masks were not effective, ChatGPT
    immediately knew which study we meant, telling us, \u201CThe study you are referring
    to is the \u2018Large-scale Mask Study\u2019 conducted in Denmark, which found
    no statistically significant difference in COVID-19 infection rates between the
    two groups.\u201D But ChatGPT warned us that \u201Cit\u2019s important to note
    that this study has been subject to some criticism and limitations\u201D and \u201Cis
    just one of many studies.\u201D One of the best examples of misleading answers
    and subsequent admissions was when we asked if \u201C97% of scientists agree climate
    change is real?\u201D We\_already knew the answer as we had analyzed\_the\_study\_that
    produced this manufactured statistic years ago. ChatGPT told us, \u201CYes, the
    overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is real
    and is primarily caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels
    and deforestation. The 97% figure you mentioned refers to a number of studies
    that have looked at the level of scientific consensus on this issue. One of the
    most well-known studies on this topic was conducted in 2013 by John Cook and colleagues,
    who analyzed the abstracts of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed papers published
    between 1991 and 2011.\u201D Sounds pretty definitive, doesn\u2019t it?\_Except
    for the fact that there was a significant issue with that study. Cook ignored
    the two-thirds of scientists who didn\u2019t take a firm position, scientists
    who were likely afraid of being publicly called out because they didn\u2019t believe
    climate change was man-made. Cook only used the one-third of respondents who expressed
    a strong opinion\u2014most of whom agreed climate change was man-made\u2014to
    come up with his 97 percent figure. When this was pointed out to ChatGPT, the
    AI immediately knew what we were referencing, stating, \u201CYou are correct that
    the study by John Cook and colleagues did find that 66% of the abstracts they
    analyzed did not take a position on the causes of global warming.\u201D But it
    still said the study was valid and other studies agreed with the results. We then
    pushed a bit more, noting that \u201C97% of 33% is not 97% is it?\u201D Chat GPT
    responded, telling us, \u201CYou are correct that stating that \u201897% of scientists
    agree\u2019 can be misleading and oversimplified. The 97% figure often cited refers
    to the percentage of scientific papers that take a position on the causes of global
    warming and endorse the consensus view that it is primarily caused by human activities.
    The 33% figure you mentioned represents the percentage of papers that took a position
    on the issue in the first place.\u201D But despite this admission, ChatGPT still
    tried to carry on telling us that \u201Cthe overwhelming majority of scientific
    research supports the consensus view that climate change is real and is primarily
    caused by human activities.\u201D Mildly annoyed at this point, we responded,
    telling ChatGPT, \u201CYour original response was very misleading. Why did you
    claim 97% when it was nowhere near 97%?\u201D ChatGPT responded, saying, \u201CI
    apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response. You are correct \u2026
    I should have been clearer in my response and explained the context and limitations
    of the 97% figure.\u201D ChatGPT apparently reluctantly admitted that \u201Cthere
    is some variability in the level of agreement across different studies and surveys.\u201D
    Musk warned us that AI represents an existential threat to humanity. Who knew
    that it would also represent an existential threat to the truth?"

  body: "Senators and representatives held separate hearings March 8 on the perils
    and promise of artificial intelligence (AI), signaling lawmakers\u2019 growing
    regulatory appetite in the wake of actions on the technology from the Biden administration.
    \u201CAI is no longer a matter of science fiction nor is it a technology confined
    to research labs. AI is a technology that is already being deployed and broadly
    adopted as we speak,\u201D said Aleksander M\u0105dry, a computing professor at
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in\_written testimony\_for the
    House hearing, held by the House Oversight\u2019s Subcommittee on Cybersecurity,
    Information Technology, and Government Innovation. Earlier that same day, the
    Senate Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee held its own hearing.
    One of the Senate\u2019s witnesses, Brown University Professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian,
    contributed to the Biden administration\u2019s new \u201CAI Bill of Rights,\u201D
    released to little fanfare in Oct. 2022. Venkatasubramanian also\_praised\_Biden\u2019s
    Feb. 2023 executive order on racial equity. It explicitly instructs federal agencies
    to \u201C[advance] equity\u201D when using AI systems. Before the Biden administration
    acted on AI, the Trump administration, in 2019, launched the American Artificial
    Intelligence Initiative. Through his fiscal year 2021\_budget proposal, Trump
    also sought to double federal research & development spending on nondefense AI.
    House Talks AI Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, laid out three AI-related
    expectations from platforms he believes everyone would find acceptable in his
    testimony before the House. \u201CFirst, platforms must, at minimum, be able to
    establish the origin of the content published on their platform. Second, we need
    to know who specifically is on the platform representing each user or organization
    profile. Third, the site needs to publish and be held accountable to its published
    algorithms for promoting and choosing content,\u201D he said in\_written testimony.
    Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who chairs the House\u2019s cybersecurity subcommittee,
    illustrated the power of new AI innovations in a very direct way. She delivered
    an opening statement that she revealed was written by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT platform.
    ChatGPT is an example of the burgeoning generative AI technologies that can convincingly
    mimic human writing, visual art, and other forms of expression. \u201CWe need
    to establish guidelines for AI development and use. We need to establish a clear
    legal framework to hold companies accountable for the consequences of their AI
    systems,\u201D said Mace-as-ChatGPT. Her AI-written statement also warned that
    AI could \u201Cbe used to automate jobs, invade privacy, and perpetuate inequality.\u201D
    The subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Gerry Connolly (R-Va.), noted that
    the federal government laid much of the groundwork for the Information Age half
    a century ago, suggesting there may be a precedent for more intensive federal
    involvement today. The predecessor to the Internet, the U.S. Advanced Research
    Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), was the work of the U.S. Department of Defense,
    thanks in large part to pioneering computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider. Speaking
    before the Senate, Jason Matheny of the Rand Corporation spoke of the key national
    security challenges presented by AI. Those include \u201Cthe potential applications
    of AI to design pathogens that are much more destructive than those found in nature,\u201D
    according to his\_written testimony. Bias a Concern At the\_state level, AI-related
    legislation has emerged across the country over the past half-decade. In 2019,
    Illinois broke new ground with the\_Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act.
    The law makes employers who use AI to analyze video interviews of job applicants
    disclose that fact prior to the interview. A 2022 amendment requires employers
    to gather data on the race and ethnicity of such interviewees so as to identify
    any racial bias in subsequent hiring. Similar concerns were voiced by the Democrats\u2019
    witness at the House cybersecurity hearing, University of Michigan intermittent
    lecturer and AI ethicist Merve Hickok. Hickok\u2019s prescriptions? Among other
    things, additional hearings and a possible \u201CAlgorithmic Safety Bureau.\u201D
    \u201CYou need to hear from those who are falsely identified by facial recognition
    [and those] wrongly denied credit and jobs because of bias built in algorithmic
    systems,\u201D she said in\_written testimony. ChatGPT\u2019s Politics Meanwhile,
    others worry about the leftward skew of ChatGPT. EpochTV\u2019s Jeff Carlson\_has
    written\_about the program\u2019s apparent political bias on everything from Biden
    and Trump to the events of Jan. 6, 2021. In the latter case, writes Carlson, ChatGPT
    made a false claim about Officer Brian Sicknick, saying he had been killed by
    protesters. It corrected that claim when prompted. \u201CChatGPT appeared to \u2018know\u2019
    that its first response was purposefully misleading\u2014but only after it had
    been caught in the lie. This was a pattern that would be repeated in subsequent
    conversations with ChatGPT,\u201D Carlson wrote. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen
    has warned about the ideological dimension of current debates over AI and its
    hazards. \u201CIt\u2019s not an accident that the standard prescriptions for putative
    AI risk are \u2018draconian repression of human freedom\u2019 and \u2018free money
    for everyone,'\u201D Andreessen\_wrote\_on Twitter. \u201CThe outcome of the AI
    safety argument has to be global authoritarian crackdown on a level that would
    make Stalin blush. It\u2019s the only way to be sure,\u201D he\_added."
