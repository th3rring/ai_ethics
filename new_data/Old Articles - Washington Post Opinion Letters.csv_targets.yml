  body: "I fear philosophy professor Lawrence Shapiro\u2019s head is in the clouds,
    at least according to what he wrote in his Feb. 10 op-ed, \u201CWhy I\u2019m not
    worried about my students using ChatGPT.\u201D He thinks only 20 percent of his
    students would use ChatGPT to write an essay for his class. As a former high school
    English teacher, college English instructor and former communications vice president
    at a national nonprofit, I can assure him that close to 100 percent, if not all,
    of his students will use ChatGPT if they have access to it to write themes for
    his class. This technology is too much of a temptation for anybody not to use
    it. ChatGPT might be the reverse of what ink and papyrus and the Gutenberg printing
    press meant to the world. Those inventions disseminated original and critical
    thinking and spurred the creation of new technologies, the Renaissance, the Industrial
    Revolution, the information age and more. Now, ChatGPT makes it easy not to think.
    Are critical thinking and forming a coherent argument dead? Yes, you can analyze
    a ChatGPT essay to see what about it works, but you\u2019re not the one putting
    together the argument and facts into a coherent whole anymore. When we don\u2019t
    have to use our brains to think critically using written language, it likely will
    have deleterious effects on our brains and, ultimately, civilization."
