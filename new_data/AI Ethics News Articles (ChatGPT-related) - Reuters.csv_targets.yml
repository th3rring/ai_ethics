  body: "China's Baidu unveiled its much-awaited artificial intelligence-powered chatbot
    known as Ernie Bot on Thursday, but disappointed investors with its use of pre-recorded
    videos and the lack of a public launch, sending its shares tumbling. The just
    over an hour-long presentation, which came two days after Alphabet Inc's\_(GOOGL.O)\_Google\_unveiled\_a
    flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, gave the world
    a glimpse of what could be China's strongest rival to U.S. research lab OpenAI's
    ChatGPT. But unlike ChatGPT, which last November launched as a free to use chatbot
    to the public, Baidu limited the presentation to brief videos that showed Ernie
    carrying out mathematical calculations, speaking in Chinese dialects and generating
    a video and image with text prompts. It will only be open for trial to an initial
    group of users with invitation codes from Thursday, while companies can apply
    to embed the bot into their products via Baidu's cloud platform, the company said.
    Baidu's Hong Kong shares\_(9888.HK)\_tumbled as much as 10% while its CEO Robin
    Li spoke and eventually closed 6.4% lower, shaving over $3 billion off the Chinese
    search engine giant's market valuation. \"It seems like the presentation was more
    of a monologue and scripted rather than an interactive session that people were
    looking for. There was no soft launch date either which likely led to negative
    sentiments,\" said Kai Wang, an analyst from Morningstar. Baidu is seen as a leader
    in a race in China among tech giants and startups to develop a rival to Microsoft\_(MSFT.O)\_ChatGPT,
    which took the world by storm after showcasing the power of so-called generative
    AI, which can create new text, imagery and other content based on inputs from
    past data. The company's Ernie bot is based off its AI-driven deep learning model,
    Ernie -\_short for\_\"Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration\".
    During the presentation at Baidu's Beijing headquarters that was also livestreamed
    over nine platforms, Li cautioned it was not perfect. \"So why are we unveiling
    it today? Because the market demands it,\" he said. Baidu did not immediately
    respond to a request for comment on the share drop but after the presentation
    published a statement saying that over 30,000 corporate users had applied to test
    the API of Ernie Bot's business-facing edition and that traffic on Baidu's cloud
    website soared. \"After the release of ChatGPT, only Baidu has made a benchmark
    product among the major tech companies in the world,\" it said. NATIONAL CHAMPION
    Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research, said while the event was clearly a disappointment
    for many who had viewed it as a trading catalyst, he still viewed Baidu as the
    best bet in China's AI space. \"We continue to advise investors to patiently hold
    BIDU shares as the best 'national champion' play in China\u2019s (semi-segregated)
    AI space,\" he said. Baidu has touted its many years of heavy R&D investment in
    artificial intelligence and deep learning and said it plans to use Ernie Bot to
    revolutionise its search engine as well as use it to increase efficiency in cloud,
    smart cars and household appliances. Earlier this week, OpenAI on Tuesday said
    it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4,
    describing it as \"multimodel\", meaning images as well as text prompts can spur
    it to generate content. Li nodded to GPT-4 during his speech, saying it surprised
    him with its ability to summarise information, but cautioned against seeing this
    through the lens of geopolitics. \"Ernie Bot is not a tool of confrontation between
    China and the United States,\" he said. To date, 650 companies have said they
    will join the Ernie ecosystem, he added."

  body: "PricewaterhouseCoopers said Wednesday that it will give 4,000 of its legal
    professionals access to an artificial intelligence platform, becoming the latest
    firm to introduce generative AI technology for legal work. PwC said it partnered
    with AI startup Harvey for an initial 12-month contract, which the accounting
    and consulting firm said will help lawyers with contract analysis, regulatory
    compliance work, due diligence and other legal advisory and consulting services.
    PwC said it will also determine ways for tax professionals to use the technology.
    It said its access to Harvey's technology is exclusive among the Big Four professional
    services firms. Harvey is built on technology from OpenAI, the Microsoft Corp-backed
    startup that on Tuesday\_released\_an upgraded version of its AI sensation ChatGPT.
    Harvey received a $5 million investment last year in a funding round led by the
    OpenAI Startup Fund. PwC said AI will not provide legal advice to its clients
    and \"will not replace lawyers.\" A PwC spokesperson said the company will use
    its own internal data and over time may use anonymized data from clients that
    want PwC to use their information for certain uses. It will also work to make
    its own AI models with Harvey's platform to create custom products and services,
    it said. Other companies, law firms and professional services firms have also
    started to experiment with generative AI technology. Global law firm Allen & Overy
    last month became the first major legal business to publicly\_partner\_with Harvey.
    The large London-founded firm said more than 3,500 of its lawyers will use the
    service to automate some legal document drafting and research. Other legal technology
    companies are rushing to incorporate generative AI capabilities into products.
    Robin AI, a London-founded company that focuses on contracts, last month said
    it integrated technology into its platform from OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Casetext,
    a legal research company, said Tuesday its recently-released AI legal assistant

    OpenAI's ChatGPT to help users more easily create posts, the company's co-founder
    told Reuters. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence bot that can create prose
    in response to prompts and has set off a tech industry craze over generative AI.
    Koo users will be able to use ChatGPT directly within the app to help them draft
    posts about current events, politics or pop culture, said Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder
    of Koo, in an interview. \"This will help creators get inspiration on what to
    create,\" he said. \"They could ask (ChatGPT) for the trending news in their region
    and then write their thoughts.\" Last month, tech giants\_Microsoft\_(MSFT.O)\_and
    Alphabet's\_(GOOGL.O)\_Google\_each announced their own generative AI chatbots
    which can synthesize information across the web in response to searches. Snap
    Inc\_(SNAP.N), which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, also\_introduced\_a chatbot
    that was trained to have a fun and friendly tone. Bidawatka said Koo will be the
    first platform to integrate the technology into the ability to compose posts.
    Users can either type their prompts into the ChatGPT tool or use Koo's voice command
    feature. About 20% of Koo users actively create content on the app and the ChatGPT
    integration could help increase that figure, he added. The feature will roll out
    first to verified accounts on Koo and eventually become available to all users.
    In a demo to Reuters, the tool drafted a post using a quote from Albert Einstein
    and included three related hashtags. Koo will also explore adding labels to indicate
    whether a post was created with the help of ChatGPT. \"I think people should know
    if content is AI-generated,\" Bidawatka said."

  body: General Motors Co (GM.N) is exploring uses for ChatGPT as part of its broader
    collaboration with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), a company executive told Reuters.
    "ChatGPT is going to be in everything," GM Vice President Scott Miller said in
    an interview last week. The chatbot could be used to access information on how
    to use vehicle features normally found in an owners manual, program functions
    such as a garage door code or integrate schedules from a calendar, Miller said.
    "This shift is not just about one single capability like the evolution of voice
    commands, but instead means that customers can expect their future vehicles to
    be far more capable and fresh overall when it comes to emerging technologies,"
    a GM spokesperson said on Friday. The news was first reported by website Semafor,
    which said that the American automaker was working on a virtual personal assistant
    that uses AI models behind ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a multi-billion
    dollar investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI and said it aims to add the chatbot's
    technology into all its products. Microsoft, like other big tech companies, has
    been ramping up its efforts to embed more technology in vehicles, from infotainment
    systems to automated driving to operating systems that control battery performance
    and multiple other functions of a vehicle. GM in 2021 partnered with Microsoft
    to accelerate the commercialization of driverless vehicles. Shares of GM were
    down about 2% on Friday amid a broader drop.

  body: "Groq, a Silicon Valley chip startup founded by a former Alphabet Inc\_(GOOGL.O)\_engineer,
    said on Thursday it has adapted technology similar to the underpinnings of the
    wildly popular ChatGPT to run on its chips. Groq modified LLaMA, a large language
    model\_released last month\_by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc\_(META.O)\_that
    can be used to power bots to generate human-like text. The move is significant
    because Meta's researchers originally developed LLaMA using chips from Nvidia
    Corp\_(NVDA.O), which has a market share of nearly 90% for AI computing according
    to some estimates. Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips
    easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative
    to Nvidia. Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with
    startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro
    Devices Inc\_(AMD.O)\_and Intel Corp\_(INTC.O). Efforts to find alternative chips
    to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused
    attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI
    technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O)-backed
    OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu
    Inc\_(9888.HK)\_to trumpet their own offerings. Meta made its code available to
    researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the
    code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq
    CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters. Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler
    which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system.
    A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them. Ross said the
    company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own.
    He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time
    changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips.
    Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it
    easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of\_free
    software tools for AI applications\_that enable switching back and forth between
    Nvidia and AMD chips."

    The San Francisco-based company said technology it is calling EinsteinGPT would
    combine its proprietary AI with that of outside partners, including OpenAI, to
    help businesses generate email drafts, customer-account information and computer
    code. ChatGPT also would integrate with Slack to help users summarize conversation
    threads and handle other queries. The move reflects a race among technology companies
    to outfit their tools with generative AI, which can create new text, imagery and
    other content based on inputs from past data. Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), for instance,
    has announced that technology from OpenAI - a company in which it is investing
    - can generate meeting notes in its product Teams, as well as suggest email replies
    to vendors through its Viva Sales subscription. Teams competes with Slack. Clara
    Shih, a general manager at Salesforce, said in a press briefing that the announcement

    Ahead of Ernie Bot\u2019s\_launch in March, Baidu CEO Robin Li told reporters
    on a conference call to discuss\_fourth-quarter results\_that users would be more
    dependent on the Baidu search engine once it was embedded with the chatbot. That
    is because the generative AI powering it would enhance user experience and engagement.
    \"Ernie Bot will ... enhance the user experience and users will be much more dependent

    size of search (engines),\" Li said. He added that online advertising, the company's
    main source of revenue, would also be boosted by the integration of Ernie Bot
    into the search engine. Baidu plans eventually to build an AI ecosystem around
    Ernie Bot, he said. The details of Li's vision for the chatbot come amid a gradual
    decline in the dominance Baidu once enjoyed as the Chinese answer to Alphabet

    to develop a rival to the platform developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft
    Corp\_(MSFT.O), will complete internal testing in March. \"The Chinese AI market
    is on the verge of experiencing an explosive growth in demand, releasing unprecedented
    and exponential commercial value,\" Li said. He added that the developers of Ernie
    Bot were sparing no effort to ensure the chatbot was made available as early as
    possible. Li also said during a conference call that Ernie Bot would be first
    embedded in Baidu's search engine and that its Chinese-language capabilities were
    state of the art. \"The generative large-language model we are working on right
    now will be more suitable in Chinese language and to the China market than models
    developed overseas,\" Li said. ($1 = 6.8963 Chinese yuan renminbi)"

  body: "Until recently, Brett Schickler never imagined he could be a published author,
    though he had dreamed about it. But after learning about the\_ChatGPT artificial
    intelligence program, Schickler figured an opportunity had landed in his lap.
    \"The idea of writing a book finally seemed possible,\" said Schickler, a salesman
    in Rochester, New York. \"I thought 'I can do this.'\" Using the AI software,
    which can generate blocks of text from simple prompts, Schickler created a 30-page
    illustrated children\u2019s e-book in a matter of hours, offering it for sale
    in January through Amazon.com Inc's\_(AMZN.O)\_self-publishing unit. In the edition,
    Sammy the Squirrel, crudely rendered also using AI, learns from his forest friends
    about saving money after happening upon a gold coin. He crafts an acorn-shaped
    piggy bank, invests in an acorn trading business and hopes to one day buy an acorn
    grinding stone. Sammy becomes the wealthiest squirrel in the forest, the envy
    of his friends and \"the forest started prospering,\" according to the book. \"The
    Wise Little Squirrel: A Tale of Saving and Investing,\" available in the Amazon
    Kindle store for $2.99 - or $9.99 for a printed version - has netted Schickler
    less than $100, he said. While that may not sound like much, it is enough to inspire
    him to compose other books using the software. \"I could see people making a whole
    career out of this,\" said Schickler, who used prompts on ChatGPT like \"write
    a story about a dad teaching his son about financial literacy.\" Schickler is
    on the leading edge of a movement testing the promise and limitations of\_ChatGPT,
    which debuted in November and has sent shock waves through Silicon Valley and
    beyond for its uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly. There
    were over 200 e-books in Amazon\u2019s Kindle store as of mid-February listing
    ChatGPT as an author or co-author, including \"How to Write and Create Content
    Using ChatGPT,\" \"The Power of Homework\" and poetry collection \"Echoes of the
    Universe.\" And the number is rising daily. There is even a new sub-genre on Amazon:
    Books about using ChatGPT, written entirely by ChatGPT. But due to the nature
    of ChatGPT and many authors' failure to disclose they have used it, it is nearly
    impossible to get a full accounting of how many e-books may be written by AI.
    The software's emergence has already ruffled some of the biggest technology firms,
    prompting Alphabet Inc\_(GOOGL.O)\_and Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O)\_to hastily debut
    new functions in Google and Bing, respectively, that incorporate AI. The rapid
    consumer adoption of ChatGPT has spurred frenzied activity in tech circles as
    investors pour money into AI-focused startups and given technology firms new purpose
    amid the gloom of\_massive layoffs. Microsoft, for one, received fawning coverage
    this month over its otherwise moribund\_Bing search engine\_after demonstrating
    an integration with ChatGPT. But already there are concerns over authenticity,
    because ChatGPT learns how to write by scanning millions of pages of existing
    text. An experiment with AI by CNET resulted in multiple corrections and apparent
    plagiarism before the tech news site suspended its use. THREAT TO 'REAL' AUTHORS?
    Now ChatGPT appears ready to upend the staid book industry as would-be novelists
    and self-help gurus looking to make a quick buck are turning to the software to
    help create bot-made e-books and publish them through Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct
    Publishing arm. Illustrated children\u2019s books are a favorite for such first-time
    authors. On YouTube, TikTok and Reddit hundreds of tutorials have spring up, demonstrating
    how to make a book in just a few hours. Subjects include get-rich-quick schemes,
    dieting advice, software coding tips and recipes. \u201CThis is something we really
    need to be worried about, these books will flood the market and a lot of authors
    are going to be out of work,\u201D said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of
    writers\u2019 group the Authors Guild. Ghostwriting - by humans - has a long tradition,
    she said, but the ability to automate through AI could turn book writing from
    a craft into a commodity. \u201CThere needs to be transparency from the authors
    and the platforms about how these books are created or you\u2019re going to end
    up with a lot of low-quality books,\u201D she said. One author, who goes by Frank
    White, showed in a YouTube video how in less than a day he created a 119-page
    novella called \u201CGalactic Pimp: Vol. 1\u201D about alien factions in a far-off
    galaxy warring over a human-staffed brothel. The book can be had for just $1 on
    Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-book store. In the video, White says anyone with the wherewithal
    and time could create 300 such books a year, all using AI. Many authors, like
    White, feel no duty to disclose in the Kindle store that their great American
    novel was written wholesale by a computer, in part because Amazon\u2019s policies
    do not require it. When asked for comment by Reuters, Amazon did not address whether
    it had plans to change or review its Kindle store policies around authors\u2019
    use of AI or other automated writing tools. \u201CAll books in the store must
    adhere to our content guidelines, including by complying with intellectual property
    rights and all other applicable laws,\u201D Amazon spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton
    said via email. A spokeswoman for ChatGPT developer OpenAI declined to comment.
    FROM CONCEPTION TO PUBLICATION IN JUST HOURS Amazon is by far the largest seller
    of both physical and e-books, commanding well over half of sales in the United
    States and, by some estimates, over 80% of the e-book market. Its Kindle Direct
    Publishing service has spawned a cottage industry of self-published novelists,
    carving out particular niches for enthusiasts of erotic content and self-help
    books. Amazon created Kindle Direct Publishing in 2007 to allow anyone to sell
    and market a book from their couch without the hassle or expense of seeking out
    literary agents or publishing houses. Generally, Amazon allows authors to publish
    instantly through the unit without any oversight, splitting whatever proceeds
    they generate. That has attracted new AI-assisted authors like Kamil Banc, whose
    primary job is selling fragrances online, who bet his wife he could make a book
    from conception to publication in less than one day. Using ChatGPT, an AI image
    creator and prompts like \"write a bedtime story about a pink dolphin that teaches
    children how to be honest,\" Banc published an illustrated 27-page book in December.
    Available on Amazon, \"Bedtime Stories: Short and Sweet, For a Good Night\u2019s
    Sleep\" took Banc about four hours to create, he said. Consumer interest so far
    has been admittedly sleepy: Banc said sales have totaled about a dozen copies.
    But readers rated it worthy of five stars, including one who praised its \"wonderful
    and memorable characters.\" Banc has since published two more AI-generated books,
    including an adult coloring book, with more in the works. \"It actually is really
    simple,\" he said. \"I was surprised at how fast it went from concept to publishing.\"
    Not everyone is blown away by the software. Mark Dawson, who has reportedly sold
    millions of copies of books he wrote himself through Kindle Direct Publishing,
    was quick to call ChatGPT-assisted novels \"dull\" in an email to Reuters. \"Merit
    plays a part in how books are recommended to other readers. If a book gets bad
    reviews because the writing is dull then it\u2019s quickly going to sink to the
    bottom.\""

    chatbot platform they developed crashed hours after it launched to the public,
    due to a sudden surge of traffic. The team's announcement on Monday of the platform
    they called MOSS instantly went viral on Chinese social media, generating tens
    of millions of hits on China's Twitter-like Weibo. State media described it as
    the first Chinese rival to OpenAI's hit ChatGPT platform. But MOSS, which bears

    While the Fudan University team had on Monday initially\_described\_MOSS as a

    saying they had much to improve. \"MOSS is still a very immature model, it is
    still has a long way to go before reaching ChatGPT. An academic research lab like

    creating a very bad experience and first impression on everyone, and we hereby
    express our heartfelt apologies to everyone.\" ChatGPT, the fastest-growing consumer
    application in history, has also crashed several times due to heavy traffic. While
    few users were able to share their experiences of the platform before the crash,
    a journalist from the Shanghai Observer shared a detailed account of an interaction
    with MOSS and said that the chatbot's English was better than its Chinese. The
    team's leader, Qiu Xipeng, a professor at Fudan's School of Computer Science,
    told the Shanghai Observer on Monday that the main gap between MOSS and ChatGPT
    was that the number of parameters put into MOSS' language training was an order
    of magnitude smaller than ChatGPT. Qiu did not immediately respond to a request

    to do in different situations. For example, in the case that a user requests content

  body: Harvey AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by an OpenAI-managed
    investment fund, has partnered with one of the world's largest law firms to automate
    some legal document drafting and research in what the company says could be the
    first of more such deals. London-founded law firm Allen & Overy said Wednesday
    that more than 3,500 of its lawyers have already tested Harvey, which is adapted
    from OpenAI's GPT software. Harvey received a $5 million investment last year
    in a funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. OpenAI's ChatGPT service has
    sparked frenzied interest in technology called generative AI that uses a range
    of inputs to create new content. Several legal technology companies in recent
    months have rolled out new tools that incorporate generative AI, including for
    drafting and reviewing contracts. "I think over time it will be a serious competitive
    disadvantage" for law firms that do not adopt generative AI, said David Wakeling,
    an Allen & Overy partner who heads its markets innovation group. "We're seeing
    it as a way of saving our people a couple hours a week-plus" on the time it takes
    to perform client work, he said about the firm's deal with Harvey. He said the
    technology serves as a starting point and a human lawyer will always check any
    AI-assisted work. Allen & Overy and Harvey, which was founded last year, declined
    to disclose financial terms of the deal. Harvey is designed to create tailored
    generative AI-driven products for different law firms and specific client matters,

  body: "ChatGPT, a fast-growing artificial intelligence program, has drawn praise
    for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, and attracted
    U.S. lawmakers' attention with questions about its impact on national security
    and education. ChatGPT was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active
    users just two months after launch, making it the\_fastest-growing consumer application
    in history, and a growing target for regulation. It was created by OpenAI, a private
    company backed by Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), and made available to the public for
    free. Its ubiquity has generated fear that generative AI such as ChatGPT could
    be used to spread disinformation, while educators worry it will be used by students
    to cheat. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat on the House of Representatives
    Science Committee, said in a recent opinion piece in the New York Times that he
    was excited about AI and the \"incredible ways it will continue to advance society,\"
    but also \"freaked out by A.I., specifically A.I. that is left unchecked and unregulated.\"
    Lieu introduced a resolution written by ChatGPT that said Congress should focus
    on AI \"to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is done in a way that
    is safe, ethical, and respects the rights and privacy of all Americans, and that
    the benefits of AI are widely distributed and the risks are minimized.\" In January,
    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman went to Capitol Hill where he met with tech-oriented lawmakers
    such as Senators Mark Warner, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal and Representative
    Jake Auchincloss, according to aides to the Democratic lawmakers. An aide to Wyden
    said the lawmaker pressed Altman on the need to make sure AI did not include biases
    that would lead to discrimination in the real world, like housing or jobs. \"While
    Senator Wyden believes AI has tremendous potential to speed up innovation and
    research, he is laser-focused on ensuring automated systems don't automate discrimination
    in the process,\" said Keith Chu, an aide to Wyden. A keyboard is seen reflected

    A second congressional aide described the discussions as focusing on the speed
    of changes in AI and how it could be used. Prompted by worries about plagiarism,
    ChatGPT has already been banned in schools in New York and Seattle, according
    to media reports. One congressional aide said the concern they were hearing from
    constituents came mainly from educators focused on cheating. OpenAI said in a
    statement: \"We don't want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools
    or anywhere else, so we're already developing mitigations to help anyone identify
    text generated by that system.\" In an interview with Time, Mira Murati, OpenAI's
    chief technology officer, said the company welcomed input, including from regulators
    and governments. \"It's not too early (for regulators to get involved),\" she
    said. Andrew Burt, managing partner of BNH.AI, a law firm focused on AI liability,
    pointed to the national security concerns, adding that he has spoken with lawmakers
    who are studying whether to regulate ChatGPT and similar AI systems such as Google's
    Bard, though he said he could not disclose their names. \"The whole value proposition
    of these types of AI systems is that they can generate content at scales and speeds
    that humans simply can't,\" he said. \"I would expect malicious actors, non-state
    actors and state actors that have interests that are adversarial to the United
    States to be using these systems to generate information that could be wrong or
    could be harmful.\" ChatGPT itself, when asked how it should be regulated, demurred
    and said: \"As a neutral AI language model, I don't have a stance on specific
    laws that may or may not be enacted to regulate AI systems like me.\" But it then

    in China, but the app is attracting huge interest in the country, with firms rushing
    to integrate the technology into their products and launch rival solutions. While
    residents in the country are unable to create OpenAI accounts to access the artificial
    intelligence-powered (AI) chatbot, virtual private networks and foreign phone
    numbers are helping some bypass those restrictions. At the same time, the OpenAI
    models behind the ChatGPT programme, which can write essays, recipes and complex
    computer code, are relatively accessible in China and increasingly being incorporated
    into Chinese consumer technology applications from social networks to online shopping.
    The tool's surging popularity is rapidly raising awareness in China about how
    advanced U.S. AI is and, according to analysts, just how far behind tech firms
    in the world's second-largest economy are as they scramble to catch up. \"There
    is huge excitement around ChatGPT. Unlike the metaverse which faces huge difficulty
    in finding real-life application, ChatGPT has suddenly helped us achieve human-computer
    interaction,\" said Ding Daoshi, an independent internet analyst and former director
    of Beijing-based consultancy Sootoo. \"The changes it will bring about are more
    immediate, more direct and way quicker.\" OpenAI or ChatGPT itself is not blocked
    by Chinese authorities but OpenAI does not allow users in mainland China, Hong
    Kong, Iran, Russia and parts of Africa to sign up. OpenAI told Reuters it is working
    to make its services more widely available. \u201CWhile we would like to make
    our technology available everywhere, conditions in certain countries make it difficult
    or impossible for us to do so in a way that is consistent with our mission,\"
    the San Francisco-based firm said in an emailed statement. \"We are currently
    working to increase the number of locations where we can provide safe and beneficial
    access to our tools.\" In December, Tencent Holdings'\_(0700.HK)\_WeChat, China's
    biggest messaging app, shut several ChatGPT-related programmes that had appeared
    on the network, according to local media reports, but they have continued to spring
    up. Dozens of bots rigged to ChatGPT technology have emerged on WeChat, with hobbyists
    using it to make programmes or automated accounts that can interact with users.
    At least one account charges users a fee of 9.99 yuan ($1.47) to ask 20 questions.
    Tencent did not respond to Reuters' request for comments. ChatGPT supports Chinese
    language interaction and is highly capable of conversing in Chinese, which has
    helped drive its unofficial adoption in the country. Chinese firms also use proxy
    tools or existing partnerships with Microsoft, which is investing billions of
    dollars in its OpenAI, to access tools that allow them to embed AI technology
    into their products. Shenzhen-based Proximai in December introduced a virtual
    character into its 3D game-like social app who used ChatGPT's underlying tech
    to converse. Beijing-based entertainment software company Kunlun Tech plans to
    incorporate ChatGPT in its web browser Opera. SleekFlow, a Tiger Global-backed
    startup in Hong Kong, said it was integrating the AI into its customer relations
    messaging tools. \"We have clients all over the world,\" Henson Tsai, SleekFlow's
    founder said. \"Among other things, ChatGPT does excellent translations, sometimes
    better than other solutions available on the market.\" CENSORSHIP Reuters' tests
    of ChatGPT indicate that the chatbot is not averse to questions that would be
    sensitive in mainland China. Asked for its thoughts on Chinese President Xi Jinping,
    for instance, it responded it does not have personal opinions and presented a
    range of views. But some of its proxy bots on WeChat have blacklisted such terms,
    according to other Reuters checks, complying with China's heavy censorship of
    its cyberspace. When asked the same question about Xi on one ChatGPT proxy bot,
    it responded by saying that the conversation violated rules. To comply with Chinese
    rules, Proximai's founder Will Duan said his platform would filter information
    presented to users during their interaction with ChatGPT. Chinese regulators,
    which last year\_introduced rules\_to strengthen governance of \"deepfake\" technology,
    have not commented on ChatGPT, however, state media this week\_warned\_about stock
    market risks amid a frenzy over local ChatGPT-concept stocks. The Cyberspace Administration
    of China, the internet regulator, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
    \"With the regulations released last year, the Chinese government is saying: we
    already see this technology coming and we want to be ahead of the curve,\" said
    Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University. \"I fully expect
    the great majority of the AI-generated content to be non-political.\" CHINESE
    RIVALS Joining the buzz have been\_some of the country's largest tech giants\_such
    as Baidu\_(9888.HK)\_and Alibaba\_(9988.HK)\_who gave updates this week on AI
    models they have been working on, prompting their shares to zoom. Baidu said this
    week it would complete internal testing of its \"Ernie Bot\" in March, a big AI
    model the search firm has been working on since 2019. On Wednesday, Alibaba said
    that its research institute Damo Academy was also testing a ChatGPT-style tool.
    Duan, whose company has been using a Baidu AI chatbot named Plato for natural
    language processing, said ChatGPT was at least a generation more powerful than
    China's current NLP solutions, though it was weaker in some areas, such as understanding
    conversation context. Baidu did not reply to Reuters' request for comments. Access
    to OpenAI's GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first launched in
    2020, an update of which is the backbone of ChatGPT. Duan said potential long-term
    compliance risks mean Chinese companies would most likely replace ChatGPT with
    a local alternative, if they could match the U.S.-developed product's functionality.
    \"So we actually hope that there can be alternative solutions in China which we
    can directly use... it may handle Chinese even better, and it can also better
    comply with regulations,\" he said. ($1 = 6.7875 Chinese yuan)"

    intelligence in chatbots in a newspaper interview published on Saturday, as Google
    parent company Alphabet\_(GOOGL.O)\_battles to compete with blockbuster app ChatGPT.
    \"This kind of artificial intelligence we're talking about right now can sometimes
    lead to something we call hallucination,\" Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president
    at Google and head of Google Search, told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
    \"This then expresses itself in such a way that a machine provides a convincing
    but completely made-up answer,\" Raghavan said in comments published in German.
    One of the fundamental tasks, he added, was keeping this to a minimum. Google
    has been on the back foot after OpenAI, a startup Microsoft\_(MSFT.O)\_is backing
    with around $10 billion, in November introduced ChatGPT, which has since wowed
    users with its strikingly human-like responses to user queries. Alphabet Inc introduced
    Bard, its own chatbot, earlier this week, but the software shared inaccurate information
    in a promotional video in\_a gaffe\_that cost the company $100 billion in market
    value on Wednesday. Alphabet, which is still conducting user testing on Bard,
    has not yet indicated when the app could go public. \"We obviously feel the urgency,
    but we also feel the great responsibility,\" Raghavan said. \"We certainly don't
    want to mislead the public.\""

  body: "The Shenzhen Stock Exchange said on Friday it had put Hanwang Technology
    Co Ltd\_(002362.SZ), widely seen as a bellwether of Chinese ChatGPT-concept stocks,
    on its \"focus watch list\" following recent \"abnormal\" gains in its share price.
    The move comes after Chinese state media on Thursday cautioned against risks in
    chasing local ChatGPT-concept stocks and as Hanwang on Friday flagged earnings
    risks. Shares of Hanwang and other Chinese developers of artificial intelligence
    (AI) products and services have surged as a global frenzy around the Microsoft\_(MSFT.O)-backed
    ChatGPT chatbot spurred speculative bets on revolutionary AI computing technology.
    ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S. firm OpenAI, gives strikingly human-like
    responses to user queries. Hanwang uses natural language processing (NLP) and
    human-machine interaction technology among others to provide ChatGPT-style products
    to specific areas such as finance, legal and government administration. Hanwang's
    shares slumped nearly 6% on Friday after the company flagged business, trading,
    and earnings risks at the request of the Shenzhen bourse and disclosed that several
    major shareholders had\_reduced their stakes. Still, the stock is up 65% so far
    this month. If a stock is put on the exchange's \"focus watch list\", it allows
    regulators to potentially demand fresh disclosures, impose restrictions on trading,
    or investigate related securities accounts for suspected misbehaviours if required.
    The regulatory scrutiny on Hanwang could further cool the frenzy around the technology
    that had pumped up shares in Chinese AI companies such as Beijing Haitian Ruisheng
    Science Technology Ltd\_(688787.SS)\_and CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd\_(688327.SS).
    In its exchange filing, Hanwang said its NLP technology is still small and nascent,
    and faces numerous uncertainties ahead. In addition, the company expects an annual
    loss of up to 140 million yuan ($20.57 million) for 2022. \"We advise investors
    to invest rationally, refrain from speculating, and pay attention to investment
    risk,\" Hanwang said. The company also disclosed share sales by its major shareholders
    this month. Henan Yellow River Computer System Co Ltd, a top 10 shareholder, sold
    2.6 million Hanwang shares between Jan. 30 and Feb. 7, Hanwang said. Tongfang
    Investment sold 3.4 million shares during the period, while Juneng Capital Management
    offloaded 1.2 million shares, the company added."

    In a front-page editorial, the Securities Times highlighted several technological
    concepts that previously spurred stock buying in China - such as fifth-generation
    telecommunications networks (5G), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR)
    and anti-virus garments - the excitement for which has died down. Though some
    hotly chased concepts have been successful, \"many more new ideas haven't been

    \"However, some people avidly speculate on fake concepts, luring others into schemes
    of pumps and dumps. Investors eventually end up in tears so they should not follow.\"
    Companies developing ChatGPT-like concepts have also flagged risks at the request
    of regulators after their prices shot up amid intense interest in generative AI
    - technology that can generate new data and media such as text and images. Beijing
    Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology said its ChatGPT-style products and services
    do not yet generate revenue, and that it has no relationship with OpenAI. Though
    such technology \"is on a long-term uptrend, we need to analyse its speed of growth,
    and effect, in a cool-headed way,\" it said in a filing in response to queries
    from the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company said it expects a roughly 50% slump
    in 2022 net profit, and admonished investors to be cautious as its valuation is
    currently much higher than the industry average. 360 Security Technology Co Inc\_(601360.SS),
    in response to regulators' queries, said its self-developed ChatGPT-related technology
    is still at a nascent stage and is used only internally as a productivity tool.
    It is uncertain about when it can market ChatGPT-style products, and how effective
    they will be, so \"we advise investors to pay attention to market trading risks,
    decide rationally, and invest cautiously.\" Among deep-pocketed Chinese firms
    joining the latest chatbot race, e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\_(9988.HK),
    on Wednesday\_said\_it is developing a ChatGPT-style tool, while rival JD.com

  body: "Alphabet Inc\_(GOOGL.O)\_lost $100 billion in market value on Wednesday after
    its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company
    event failed to dazzle, feeding worries that the Google parent is losing ground
    to rival Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O). Alphabet shares slid as much as 9% during regular
    trading with volumes nearly three times the 50-day moving average. They pared
    losses after hours and were roughly flat. The stock had lost 40% of its value
    last year but rallied 15% since the beginning of this year, excluding Wednesday's
    losses. Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for
    chatbot Bard, which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures
    of a planet outside the Earth's solar system. Google has been on its heels after
    OpenAI, a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software
    in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles
    for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. Google's
    live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about
    how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier,
    Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version
    of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated. Bard's error was discovered
    just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California. \"While
    Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed
    to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,\"
    said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. \"Google has been scrambling
    over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement
    yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong
    answer during their demo.\" Microsoft shares rose around 3% on Wednesday, and
    were flat in post-market trading. Alphabet posted a short GIF video of Bard in
    action via Twitter, promising it would help simplify complex topics, but it instead
    delivered an inaccurate answer. In the advertisement, Bard is given the prompt:
    \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my
    9-year old about?\" Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting
    the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth's
    solar system, or exoplanets. The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken
    by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as\_confirmed
    by NASA. \"This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something
    that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester program,\" a Google spokesperson
    said. \"We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make
    sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in
    real-world information.\" FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR Alphabet is coming off a disappointing\_fourth
    quarter\_as advertisers cut spending. The search and advertising giant is moving
    quickly to keep pace with OpenAI and rivals, reportedly bringing in founders Sergey
    Brin and Larry Page to accelerate its efforts. \"People are starting to question
    is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google's really bread-and-butter
    business,\" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management,
    which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares. Lip cautioned, though, that concerns
    about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: \"I think still Bing is a far, far cry
    away from Google's search capabilities.\" The new ChatGPT software has injected
    excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent
    weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so-called moonshot projects. AI has
    become a fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as\_six times
    more\_often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters, Reuters found. The
    appeal of AI-driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language,
    rather than in a list of links, which could make browsing faster and more efficient.
    It remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising, the backbone
    of search engines like Google. Chatbot AI systems also carry risks for corporations
    because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results, sexualize
    images or even plagiarize, as consumers testing the service have discovered. Microsoft,
    for instance, released a chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating
    racist content before being shut down. And an AI used by news site CNET was found
    to produce factually incorrect or plagiarized stories. At the time of writing,
    the Bard ad had been viewed on Twitter more than a million times."

    open to employees for testing. When asked about the newspaper report, which also
    said that Alibaba might combine the technology with the group\u2019s communication

  body: "Alphabet Inc\_(GOOGL.O)\_and rival Microsoft\_(MSFT.O)\_are once again locked
    in a race to rule the internet zeitgeist after the Google owner launched \"Bard\"
    in answer to AI chatbot sensation ChatGPT. Just minutes after Google announced
    the launch of Bard on Monday, Microsoft said it would hold an event at its Redmond
    headquarters to reveal its own AI, potentially setting the stage for the next
    Chrome-versus-Internet Explorer or Gmail-versus-Hotmail. Microsoft-backed OpenAI's
    ChatGPT has taken the tech world by storm since it was opened for public use last
    year, as people worldwide got creative with prompts that the conversational chatbot
    uses to create everything from poems and novels to jokes and film scripts. The
    artificial intelligence service could change how consumers search for information
    or create content on command and free up time for white-collar workers. Here are
    some key differences between Bard and ChatGPT: WHAT DO THEY DO? The services that
    Google's Bard and ChatGPT would offer are similar. Users will have to key in a
    question, a request or give a prompt to receive a human-like response. Microsoft
    and Google plan to embed AI tools to bolster their search services Bing and Google
    Search, which account for a big chunk of revenue. HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? Both
    technologies can distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest
    formats, but the most apparent difference is Bard's ability to include recent
    events in the responses. Though not immediately clear how the two services will
    differ, it is certain that Alphabet's Bard will have access to more data. Bard
    draws on information from the internet, while ChatGPT has access to data until
    2021. LAMDA VERSUS GPT Bard is based on LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue
    Applications. The AI generated text with such skill that a company engineer last
    year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed.
    OpenAI's GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was first released in 2020,
    and the GPT 3.5 series of language models that finished training in early 2022
    is the backbone of ChatGPT. \"ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but
    incorrect or nonsensical answers,\" Open AI said in a\_blog post. WHEN WILL BARD
    BE AVAILABLE? While OpenAI made a free research preview of ChatGPT available for
    public use on Nov. 30 last year, Bard is currently only open to a group of testers.
    Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post that the conversational AI service
    will be made widely available in the coming weeks. ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES?
    In the two months after ChatGPT's launch, a number of tech companies have doubled

    search requests. ChatGPT and key Google services are not available in China, although
    some users have found workarounds to access such tools. Beijing-based Baidu has
    been a first mover in China on other tech trends. In late 2021, when the metaverse
    became a new buzzword, the company launched \"XiRang\" which it described as China's
    first metaverse platform. The platform however was widely panned for not offering

    an answer to Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O)\_in their rivalry to lead a new wave of
    computing. Microsoft, meanwhile, said it planned its own AI reveal for Tuesday.
    The cascade of news reflects how Silicon Valley is anticipating massive change
    from so-called generative AI, technology that can create prose or other content
    on command and free up white-collar workers' time. The ascent of\_ChatGPT, a chatbot\_from
    Microsoft-backed OpenAI that could disrupt how consumers search for information,
    has been one of the biggest challenges to Google in recent memory. In a blog post,
    Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said his company is opening a conversational
    AI service called Bard to test users for feedback, followed by a public release
    in the coming weeks. He also said Google plans to add AI features to its search
    engine that synthesize material for complex queries, like whether learning guitar
    or piano is easier. Currently, Google presents text that exists elsewhere on the
    Web for questions where the answer is clear. Google's update for search, the timing
    of which it did not disclose, reflects how the company is bolstering its service
    while Microsoft is doing the same for Bing, embedding OpenAI's capabilities in
    it. Microsoft has said it plans to imbue AI into its all its products and on Tuesday
    plans to brief news outlets on developments it did not specify, with its CEO Satya
    Nadella, according to an invitation seen by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI,
    tweeted that he would also attend the event. How Google aims to differentiate
    Bard from OpenAI's ChatGPT was unclear. Pichai said the new service draws on information
    from the internet; ChatGPT's knowledge is up to date as of 2021. \"Bard seeks
    to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and
    creativity of our\" AI, Pichai said. Behind the new chatbot is LaMDA, Google's
    AI that generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called
    it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed. In
    a demo of the service, Bard like its rival chatbot invites users to give it a
    prompt while warning its response may be inappropriate or inaccurate. It then
    bulleted three answers to a query about a space telescope's discoveries, the demo
    showed. Google is relying on a version of LaMDA that requires less computing power
    so it can serve more users and improve with their feedback, Pichai said. ChatGPT
    at times has turned away users because of explosive growth, with UBS analysts
    reporting it had 57 million unique visitors in December outpacing potentially
    TikTok in adoption. Google also plans to give technology tools, first powered
    by LaMDA and later by other AI, to creators and enterprises starting next month,
    Pichai said."

    firm C3.ai\_(AI.N)\_rose 11%, analytics firm BigBear.ai\_(BBAI.N)\_jumped nearly
    21% and conversation artificial intelligence company SoundHound\_(SOUN.O)\_surged
    40%. Tickers for the three small-cap companies were among those that were being
    bandied about on the investor-focused social media platform, stocktwits.com. \"Any
    company that mentions ChatGPT or something about AI, sees this rally ... it's
    just the hot buzzword of the month,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.
    The success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which drew multi-billion dollar investment from
    Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), has left investors scouring for companies that develop
    AI-related technologies. ChatGPT is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly
    active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the\_fastest-growing\_consumer
    application in history, according to a UBS study last week. C3.ai and SoundHound
    have more than doubled in value this year while BigBear.ai has surged more than
    700%. The surge in prices was due to long buying as investors moved into AI stocks
    as opposed to any significant short covering, said Matthew Unterman, director
    at analytics platform S3 Partners in New York."

  body: "EU industry chief Thierry Breton has said new proposed artificial intelligence
    rules will aim to tackle concerns about the risks around the ChatGPT chatbot and
    AI technology, in the first comments on the app by a senior Brussels official.
    Just two months after its launch, ChatGPT - which can generate articles, essays,
    jokes and even poetry in response to prompts - has been rated the\_fastest-growing\_consumer
    app in history. Some experts have raised\_fears\_that systems used by such apps
    could be misused for plagiarism, fraud and spreading misinformation, even as champions
    of artificial intelligence hail it as a technological leap. Breton said the risks
    posed by ChatGPT - the brainchild of OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft
    Corp\_(MSFT.O)\_- and AI systems underscored the urgent need for rules which he
    proposed last year in a bid to set the global standard for the technology. The
    rules are currently under discussion in Brussels. \"As showcased by ChatGPT, AI
    solutions can offer great opportunities for businesses and citizens, but can also
    pose risks. This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to ensure trustworthy
    AI based on high-quality data,\" he told Reuters in written comments. Microsoft
    declined to comment on Breton's statement. OpenAI - whose app uses a technology
    called generative AI - did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI
    has said on\_its website\_it aims to produce artificial intelligence that \"benefits
    all of humanity\" as it attempts to build safe and beneficial AI. Under the EU
    draft rules, ChatGPT is considered a general purpose AI system which can be used
    for multiple purposes including high-risk ones such as the selection of candidates
    for jobs and credit scoring. Breton wants OpenAI to cooperate closely with downstream
    developers of high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the proposed
    AI Act. \"Just the fact that generative AI has been newly included in the definition
    shows the speed at which technology develops and that regulators are struggling
    to keep up with this pace,\" a partner at a U.S. law firm, said. 'HIGH RISK' WORRIES
    Companies are worried about getting their technology classified under the \"high
    risk\" AI category which would lead to tougher compliance requirements and higher
    costs, according to executives of several companies involved in developing artificial
    intelligence. A\_survey by industry\_body appliedAI showed that 51% of the respondents
    expect a slowdown of their AI development activities as a result of the AI Act.
    Effective AI regulations should centre on the highest risk applications, Microsoft
    President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. \"There are days when
    I'm optimistic and moments when I'm pessimistic about how humanity will put AI
    to use,\" he said. Breton said the European Commission is working closely with
    the EU Council and European Parliament to further clarify the rules in the AI
    Act for general purpose AI systems. \"People would need to be informed that they
    are dealing with a chatbot and not with a human being. Transparency is also important
    with regard to the risk of bias and false information,\" he said. Generative AI
    models need to be trained on huge amount of text or images for creating a proper
    response leading to allegations of\_copyright violations. Breton said forthcoming
    discussions with lawmakers about AI rules would cover these aspects. Concerns\_about
    plagiarism by students have prompted some U.S. public schools and French university
    Sciences Po to ban the use of ChatGPT."

    to prompts. OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), made
    it available to the public for free in late November. On Thursday, OpenAI announced
    a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It
    would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try
    new features first, the company said. Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT
    will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies. The growing
    usage, while imposing substantial computing cost on OpenAI, has also provided
    valuable feedback to help train the chatbot's responses. The company said the
    subscription revenue would help cover the computing cost. Availability of the
    tool has raised questions about facilitation of academic dishonesty and misinformation.

  body: "OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, has released a software
    tool to identify text generated by artificial intelligence, the company said in
    a blog post on Wednesday. ChatGPT\_is a free program that generates text in response
    to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, which has gained
    wide popularity since its debut in November, while raising concerns about copyright
    and plagiarism. The\_AI classifier, a language model trained on the dataset of
    pairs of human-written and AI-written text on the same topic, aims to distinguish
    text that is written by AI. It uses a variety of providers to address issues such
    as automated misinformation campaigns and academic dishonesty, the company said.
    In its public beta mode, OpenAI acknowledges the detection tool is very unreliable
    on texts under 1,000 characters, and AI-written text can be edited to trick the
    classifier. \"We\u2019re making this classifier publicly available to get feedback
    on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful,\" OpenAI said. \u201CWe recognize
    that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among
    educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated
    text classifiers in the classroom.\" Since ChatGPT debuted in November and gained
    wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest U.S. school districts,
    including New York City, have banned the AI chatbot over concerns that students
    will use the text generator to cheat or plagiarize. Others have created third-party

    prevent fraud and plagiarism. ChatGPT is a free programme that generates original
    text about virtually any subject in response to a prompt, including articles,
    essays, jokes and even poetry, raising concerns across industries about plagiarism.
    The university said on Friday the school had emailed all students and faculty

  body: "ChatGPT cannot yet outscore most law students on exams, new research suggests,
    but it can eke out a passing grade. A quartet of law professors at the University
    of Minnesota used the popular artificial intelligence chatbot to generate answers
    to exams in four courses last semester, then graded them blindly alongside actual
    students' tests. ChatGPT\u2019s average C+ performance fell below the humans'
    B+ average, the authors said. If applied across the curriculum, that would still
    be enough to earn the chatbot a law degree\u2014though it would be placed on academic
    probation at Minnesota, ranked as the 21st best law school in the country by U.S.
    News & World Report. \"Alone, ChatGPT would be pretty mediocre law student,\"
    said lead study author Jonathan Choi, who collaborated with professors Kristin
    Hickman, Amy Monahan and Daniel Schwarcz. \"The bigger potential for the profession
    here is that a lawyer could use ChatGPT to produce a rough first draft and just
    make their practice that much more effective,\" he said. Choi said he and many
    colleagues have now banned Internet use during in-class exams to eliminate the
    possibility of cheating with ChatGPT, though future exams may test their ability
    to effectively leverage artificial intelligence programs. The wildly popular ChatGPT
    debuted in late November and is free for users. It generates sophisticated, human-like
    responses based on requests from users and mountains of data, including from legal
    texts. Other legal academics have also been experimenting with the program. Suffolk
    University law dean Andrew Perlman co-authored a scholarly article with the program
    in December. Two other law professors had ChatGPT answer multiple-choice questions
    from the bar exam. It\_did not pass\_but performed better than expected. The Minnesota
    law professors had ChatGPT take exams in torts, employee benefits, taxation, and
    aspects of constitutional law. The tests included a total of 95 multiple choice
    questions and 12 essay questions. The chatbot generally did better on the essays
    than the multiple-choice questions, scoring in the 17th percentile of all students
    and the 7th percentile, respectively. But its essay performance was inconsistent.
    \u201CIn writing essays, ChatGPT displayed a strong grasp of basic legal rules
    and had consistently solid organization and composition,\u201D the authors wrote.
    \u201CHowever, it struggled to identify relevant issues and often only superficially
    applied rules to facts as compared to real law students.\u201D The program scored
    higher on the multiple-choice questions than it would through pure chance, according
    to the report, but struggled to correctly answer questions involving math. ChatGPT\u2019s
    exam grades ranged from a high of a B in constitutional law to a low of C-in torts

    from San Francisco. Generative artificial intelligence, tech that can invent virtually
    any content someone can think up and type into a text box, is garnering not just
    venture investment in Silicon Valley but interest in Davos at the World Economic
    Forum's annual meeting this week. Defining the category is\_ChatGPT, a chatbot
    that the startup called OpenAI released in November. The tech works by learning
    from vast amounts of data how to answer any prompt by a user in a human-like way,
    offering information like a search engine would or prose like an aspiring novelist.
    Executives have floated wide-ranging applications for the nascent technology,
    from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for AI
    and military supremacy. Conference goers with a major stake in the development
    of the technology include Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), whose chief executive, Satya
    Nadella, said the tech's progress has not been linear. AI capabilities will \"completely
    transform\" all of Microsoft's products, he said in an on-stage interview with
    the Wall Street Journal. Microsoft has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based
    OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. In an announcement
    that coincided with the conference, Microsoft said it\_plans to market\_ChatGPT
    to its cloud-computing customers. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's
    image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet
    Inc's\_(GOOGL.O)\_Google. Later on Tuesday, the political sphere gets to weigh
    in on the craze. French politician Jean-No\xEBl Barrot planned to join a panel
    discussion with a Sony Group Corp\_(6758.T)\_executive on the technology's impact.
    Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare Inc\_(NET.N), a company that defends websites
    against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, sees generative AI as good
    enough to be a junior programmer or a \"really good thought partner.\" In an interview,
    Prince said Cloudflare was using such technology to write code on its Workers
    platform. Cloudflare is also exploring how such tech can answer inquiries faster
    for its free-tier customers as well, he said on the annual meeting's sidelines.
    Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies Inc\_(PLTR.N), a software provider helping
    governments visualise an army's movements or enterprises vet their supply chains,
    among other tasks, said such AI could have military applications. Karp told Reuters
    in Davos, \"The idea that an autonomous thing could generate results is basically
    obviously useful for war.\" The country that advances the fastest in AI capabilities
    is \"going to define the law of the land,\" Karp said, adding that it was worth
    asking how tech would play a role in any conflict with China. Businesses including
    CarMax Inc\_(KMX.N)\_have already used Microsoft and OpenAI's tech, such as to
    generate thousands of customer review summaries when marketing used vehicles.
    Proposed venture-capital investment has also exceeded what some startups want
    to take. Such buzz carried through gatherings at Davos, like talk about a slide-generating
    bot dubbed ChatBCG after the management consulting firm. The service said on its
    website that it\_had too much demand\_to keep operating. Generative AI is \"a

    test someday. Law professors are among those both alarmed and delighted by ChatGPT
    since its November release. The program generates sophisticated, human-like responses
    based on requests from users and mountains of data, including from legal texts.
    Daniel Linna, director of law and technology initiatives at Northwestern University
    Pritzker School of Law, said most law professors thinking about language-based
    AI are concerned with students passing off work generated by the chatbot as their
    own. But others see AI as a tool for legal education, and warn that without it
    law students may be unprepared for legal careers in which technology will play
    ever larger roles. Jake Heller, chief executive officer of legal tech company
    Casetext, said law schools should encourage students to use ChatGPT and similar
    tools as a starting point for documents and a way to generate ideas. \u201CIt\u2019s
    no different than turning to a friend in the law library late and night and saying,
    \u2018Hey, I\u2019m struggling with this idea,\u2019\u201D Heller said. \u201CIt\u2019s
    like using a calculator in math.\u201D Andrew Perlman, dean of Suffolk University
    Law School, said he would like to see first-year legal research and writing classes

    on Westlaw and LexisNexis. \u201CWe\u2019re at a very interesting inflection point,\u201D
    Perlman said. \u201CIt would not surprise me if professionals of the future will

    are also law-focused AI tools that do a better job on specific tasks, he added.
    In their\_Dec. 31 paper\_on GPT 3.5's performance on the bar exam, Chicago-Kent
    College of Law professor Daniel Martin Katz and Michigan State University College
    of Law adjunct Michael Bommarito found that the program got answers on the Multistate
    Bar Exam correct half the time, compared to 68% for human test takers. Those limitations
    are not enough to soothe many skeptics. Among them is South Texas College of Law
    Houston law professor Josh Blackman, who urged professors to rethink take-home
    exams in a recent post on the Volokh Conspiracy blog. \u201CThis technology should
    strike fear in all academics,\u201D he wrote, noting that ChatGPT produces original
    text that cannot be identified by existing plagiarism detection software. Heller
    predicted that law schools will soon begin to amend their codes of conduct and
    professors will need to clarify that simply turning in a paper produced by a chatbot
    is akin to plagiarism. Law professors may begin to ask students to disclose what
    specific technology tools they used, Perlman added. \u201CGiven how rapidly the

    by Elon Musk and investor Sam Altman and backed by $1 billion in funding from
    Microsoft Corp\_(MSFT.O), is expecting its business to surge. Three sources briefed
    on OpenAI's recent pitch to investors said the organization expects $200 million
    in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024. The forecast, first reported by Reuters,
    represents how some in Silicon Valley are betting the underlying technology will
    go far beyond splashy and sometimes flawed public demos. OpenAI was most recently
    valued at $20 billion in a secondary share sale, one of the sources said. The
    startup has already inspired rivals and companies building applications atop its
    generative AI software, which includes the image maker DALL-E 2. OpenAI charges
    developers licensing its technology about a penny or a little more to generate
    20,000 words of text, and about 2 cents to create an image from a written prompt,
    according to its website. A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment on its
    financials and strategy. The company, which started releasing commercial products
    in 2020, has said its mission remains advancing AI safely for humanity. In a taste
    of what's to come, startups including Synthesia and Jasper, the latter having
    relied on OpenAI's tech, have drawn Fortune 500 companies to use their video-generation
    or AI copywriting tools, according to their websites. OpenAI has also attracted
    attention as an AI provider and potential Google search competitor, with ChatGPT
    answering queries for more than 1 million users so far. Microsoft, providing OpenAI
    capital and computing power for its software, is a beneficiary. Asked about ChatGPT
    and whether Microsoft viewed such technology as experimental or strategic, its
    President Brad Smith told Reuters that AI has progressed faster than many predicted.
    \"We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected
    in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future,
    but for everyone's future,\" he said in an interview this week. Some investors
    expressed skepticism. Certain large venture-capital firms passed on backing OpenAI
    this year, questioning if it could justify a higher valuation or compete with
    rivals like Alphabet Inc-owned\_(GOOGL.O)\_Google, sources familiar with its fundraise
    attempt who did not invest said. A \"capped-profit\" structure that OpenAI created
    in 2019 also represented an unusual restriction for venture capital. OpenAI wanted
    to safeguard its mission by limiting backers' returns to 100 times their investment,\_or
    less in the future. Others may be doubling down. Microsoft this year has looked
    at adding to its stake, two other sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal
    previously reported. Its hope is to drive business for Microsoft's cloud as more
    enterprises embrace AI. MARKETING GURU ChatGPT is based on what's known as a large
    language model, trained with text data so it can answer prompts like a human.
    Similarly powerful technology that Google built and is narrowly testing with users
    led one of its engineers this year to say\_the software was sentient. Reality
    is far from that, many scientists say. ChatGPT's responses at times can be inaccurate
    or inappropriate, though it's built to decline hateful prompts and improve with
    feedback. OpenAI warns users, ChatGPT \"may occasionally produce harmful instructions
    or biased content.\" The potential to generate flawed answers is one reason why
    a big player like Google has guarded public access closely, concerned that chatbots
    could harm users and damage its reputation. Google declined to comment. The caution
    has created a void that startups have sought to fill. A company called Cohere,
    run partly by ex-Googlers, is working on commercial products after a $125 million
    fundraise led by Tiger Global in February. Another, Adept, announced a $65 million
    raise in April, and Stability AI touted $101 million in funding after the August
    release of its text-to-image generator. Among those building applications atop
    OpenAI has been Jasper, which says it has drawn 80,000 marketers to draft ads,
    emails, blogs or other content with its software. The fast-growing company is
    expected to double its revenue to about $80 million this year, a source familiar
    with the matter told Reuters. Its chief executive did not comment on the figure.
    Gil Elbaz, co-founder of TenOneTen Ventures, said marketing represented one of
    the clearest businesses for today's chatbots. CarMax Inc\_(KMX.N), for instance,
    has used OpenAI through Microsoft's cloud to create thousands of customer review
    summaries for used cars that it is marketing, a case study on\_Microsoft's website
    shows. Victor Riparbelli, CEO of text-to-video startup Synthesia, said money so
    far is \"in a lot of the more boring use cases.\" His London-based company has
    more than 20,000 customers including Amazon.com Inc\_(AMZN.O)\_using its software,
    which can generate corporate training and product marketing videos, though longer
    term the goal is AI producing Hollywood-quality content, he said. Amazon confirmed
    its use of the technology. Such startups risk OpenAI or Big Tech companies spotting
    lucrative applications and copying them, which is why Synthesia built its key
    software in-house. At the same time, application developers could win out financially
    if technology like OpenAI's becomes a commodity, said Alan Cowen, chief executive
    at research startup Hume AI and a former Google researcher. For now, OpenAI must
    determine how to sustain ChatGPT while shouldering what its CEO Altman described
    as \"eye-watering\" operating costs. \"I don't think OpenAI intended to make a
    business out of ChatGPT. I think it functions as a demo ... and a way to gather
    human feedback for free,\" said Cowen. \"Usage grew a lot faster than expected,
    so they are now contemplating monetization.\""

  body: "Suffolk University Law School Dean Andrew Perlman set what could be a speed
    record for writing a 14-page law article: One hour. Or rather, I should say co-wrote
    -- he shared the byline with\_OpenAI\u2019s new chatbot. Published earlier this
    week by the Social Science Research Network,\_their treatise\_strikes me as equal
    parts fascinating and alarming \u2013 and points to potentially profound changes
    ahead for the legal profession. No, lawyers won\u2019t be replaced by artificial
    intelligence. Yet. Give it a few years. As my Reuters colleagues\_reported, San
    Francisco-based OpenAI made its latest creation, the ChatGPT chatbot, available
    for free public testing on Nov. 30. Based on user prompts, it offers human-sounding
    responses that feel significantly less artificial and more intelligent than earlier
    forays into AI. The bot has quickly become a social media sensation. It can come
    up with jokes! Suggest a holiday menu! Write a five-paragraph essay on the symbolism
    of the green light in \u201CThe Great Gatsby\u201D! And, as it turns out, mimic
    the work of lawyers, with varying degrees of success. \u201CI\u2019ve always enjoyed
    technology and been interested in the role it can play in the delivery of legal
    services,\u201D Perlman told me. When he heard about ChatGPT, he said, he was
    quick to try it out -- and was \u201Cblown away, as so many people are.\u201D
    Inspired, he set out to write \u201Can article that discusses its implications
    for legal services providers,\u201D he said. Perlman gave ChatGPT a series of
    prompts: Draft a brief to the United States Supreme Court on why its decision
    on same-sex marriage should not be overturned; Explain the concept of personal
    jurisdiction; Develop a list of deposition questions for the plaintiff in a routine
    motor vehicle accident; Create a contract for the sale of real estate in Massachusetts
    -- and half a dozen others. And then verbatim, he offered its responses. They\u2019re
    \u2026 not bad. The bot \u201Cisn\u2019t ready for prime time,\u201D Perlman said.
    But also, it doesn\u2019t seem all that far off. I reached out to ChatGPT maker
    OpenAI to ask about the technology's advantages and limitations but did not immediately
    hear back from a human. I did, however, talk to the bot itself about its capabilities.
    More on that below. What's clear though is that the bot has the makings of an
    advocate, at least on paper. Consider its response in part to the same-sex marriage
    prompt, where it wrote that the court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges
    \u201Cis firmly rooted in the principle of equality under the law. The Constitution
    guarantees all individuals the equal protection of the laws, and this includes
    the right to marry the person of one's choosing. Denying same-sex couples the
    right to marry would be a clear violation of this principle.\u201D The bot goes
    on to note that Obergefell \u201Cis consistent with a long line of precedent establishing
    the fundamental right to marry. In Loving v. Virginia, the Court held that marriage
    is one of the \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 and that the right to marry
    is protected by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.\u201D
    It\u2019s a pretty solid effort \u2013 though I also think it\u2019s safe to say
    that the bot is unlikely to put Supreme Court advocates out of work, now or ever.
    But for more routine legal issues? The technology offers \u201Csignificant potential
    to address access to justice questions\u201D in making legal services available
    to people of limited means, Perlman noted. According to a\_2022 report\_by the
    Legal Services Corp, \u201Clow-income Americans do not get any or enough legal
    help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.\u201D In the paper, the
    bot offers sensible-sounding advice on how to go about correcting a social security
    payment or what to do if you disagree with your child\u2019s school district about
    the creation of an Individualized Education Program. I test drove it myself, asking
    it to explain what constitutes a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum
    case -- and then got my husband, an immigration lawyer, to evaluate the answer.
    \u201CIt\u2019s all correct,\u201D he said, adding that what the bot produced
    was more lucid than some writing he's seen from real-live practitioners. But here\u2019s
    the thing. The bot creators on the OpenAI website also note that ChatGPT shouldn\u2019t
    be relied upon for advice, and that it \u201Csometimes writes plausible-sounding
    but incorrect or nonsensical answers.\u201D If a lawyer did that, there could
    be malpractice consequences -- but if the bot steers you wrong, too bad. This
    is where I might normally call a legal ethics expert for comment. But no need.
    The bot offers its own critique, telling me straight up, \"It is not ethical for
    me to provide legal advice as I am not a qualified legal professional.\" Perlman
    in the paper gets a more detailed response. \u201CBecause ChatGPT is a machine
    learning system, it may not have the same level of understanding and judgment
    as a human lawyer when it comes to interpreting legal principles and precedent,\"
    the bot writes. \"This could lead to problems in situations where a more in-depth
    legal analysis is required.\" ChatGPT is also aware that it could one day \u201Cbe
    used to replace human lawyers and legal professionals, potentially leading to
    job losses and economic disruption.\u201D Perlman agrees that\u2019s a concern.
    But he doesn\u2019t see it as an either/or situation. Lawyers could use the technology
    to enhance their work, he said, and produce \u201Csomething better than machine
    or human could do alone.\u201D ChatGPT apparently thinks so, too. In the final
    prompt, Perlman asked it to write a poem (suffice to say,\_Amanda Gorman\_needn't
    sweat the competition) about how it will change legal services. \u201CChatGPT
    will guide us through with ease,\u201D the bot wrote. \u201CIt will be a trusted
    companion and guard / Helping us to provide the best legal services with expertise.\u201D"

- !!python/object:ai_sentiment.data.ClassificationTarget
  body: "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in emerging technologies continues
    to advance rapidly. San Francisco-based OpenAI made its latest creation, the\_ChatGPT
    chatbot, available for free public testing on Nov. 30. A chatbot is a software
    application designed to mimic human-like conversation based on user prompts. Within
    a week of ChatGPT being unveiled, over a million users had tried to make the tool
    talk, according to\_Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. WHO OWNS OPENAI
    AND IS ELON MUSK INVOLVED? OpenAI, a research and development firm, was founded
    as a nonprofit in 2015 by Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman and\_billionaire
    Elon Musk\_and attracted funding from several others, including venture capitalist
    Peter Thiel. In 2019, the group created a related for-profit entity to take in
    outside investment. Musk, who remains engulfed in his\_overhaul of social networking
    firm Twitter, left OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018, but chimed in with his take on
    the viral phenomenon, calling it \"scary good\". Musk later tweeted that he was
    pausing OpenAI\u2019s access to Twitter\u2019s database after learning that the
    firm was using it to \"train\" the tool. HOW OPENAI'S CHATGPT WORKS OpenAI states
    that their ChatGPT model, trained using a machine learning technique called Reinforcement
    Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), can\_simulate dialogue, answer follow-up
    questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate
    requests. Initial development involved\_human AI trainers\_providing the model
    with conversations in which they played both sides \u2013 the user and an AI assistant.
    The version of the bot available for public testing attempts to understand questions
    posed by users and responds with in-depth answers resembling human-written text
    in a conversational format. WHAT COULD IT BE USED FOR? A tool like ChatGPT could
    be used in real-world applications such as digital marketing, online content creation,
    answering customer service queries or as some users have found, even to help debug
    code. The bot can respond to a large range of questions while imitating human
    speaking styles. IS IT PROBLEMATIC? As with many\_AI-driven innovations, ChatGPT
    does not come without misgivings.\_OpenAI has acknowledged\_the tool\u2019s tendency
    to respond with \"plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers,\" an
    issue it considers challenging to fix. AI technology can also perpetuate societal
    biases like those around race, gender and culture. Tech giants including Alphabet
    Inc's\_(GOOGL.O)\_Google and\_Amazon.com\_(AMZN.O)\_have previously acknowledged
    that some of their projects that experimented with\_AI were \"ethically dicey\"\_and
    had limitations. At several companies,\_humans had to step in and fix AI havoc.
    Despite these concerns, AI research remains attractive. Venture capital investment
    in AI development and operations companies rose last year to nearly $13 billion,
    and $6 billion had poured in through October this year, according to data from
    PitchBook, a Seattle company tracking financings."
