I mean the destination and not only the enroute time.\n\nI guess it's using the data collected about me and my past travels. I also guess the solution it uses is well kept secret but I wonder what kind of algorithm can be used for that.\n\n\nI think a neural network can be used based on past travel, time and locations. I'm pretty neophyte about that and I'm wondering what could be the alternatives. I also think that a neural network must be trained per driver and that seems pretty unrealistic.

I've started to write Barn like at the beginning of October because I was really bored and didn't have any goal.\n\nBut more about Barn, It's an compiled programming language to C++. For now it is in 0.1v BETA version, which means it don't pointers, arrays and also format arguments for now, but I want to do them in future. Now im working on 0.2v which is improving everything that I've done wrong in the first version like ugly if conditions, new auto type for variable and some more stuff. Syntax is very easy and here's the example of it\n\n```\n@import \"std.ba\"\n\nfun main() {\n   println(\"Hello World\")\n}\n```\n\nI will really appreciate if you will look at mine project and maybe give a star on my github repository, Thanks y'all \ud83e\udda7\n\nHere's some important links:\n\ud83c\udf0e Website: https://barn-lang.github.io/barn-docs (where u can find link to our discord server where i update the little barn community on some changes)\n\ud83d\uddffGithub Repository: https://github.com/barn-lang/barn\n\ud83e\udd95 Discord server \"Barn Enjoyers \ud83d\uddff\": You can find the link on barn website\n\nHave a nice day/night! \ud83d\udc7a",

Initially I could only relate the performance drop to having a 2nd display connected. Eventually realized I wasn't exactly controlling the environment and the actual cause was me clicking on a window outside of the benchmarking app. I reproduced this with Samsung Magician as well as CrystalDiskMark.\n\nWhat's weird to me though is that it only happens with the PM9A1 and not with the 980. Can anyone explain the nitty gritty details in why this may be?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/r8hXBF0](https://imgur.com/a/r8hXBF0)\n\nFirst row of screenshots was me clicking on another window (like Task Manager or AW Command Center).

I understand that generic idea-seeking posts aren't allowed due to duplication, but I believe this is more of a discussion and not something that's well covered.\n\nI'm trying to figure out a good method of teaching genetic algorithms to second year university CS students, as part of their AI unit. It will probably take up a few weeks of content at most.\n\nAt the moment, I'm considering building an extendable genetic algorithm whereby the students can add their own methods for things such as selection (e.g., adding roulette).\n\nThe idea is to introduce GAs visually first, and so I am hoping to rely on something entertaining and intuitive (but somewhat abstracted away from them) for the GA itself. Something like this [genetic cars algorithm](https://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/) comes to mind.\n\nEssentially, my thoughts are that they will be learning by observing the baseline GA I provide to them, and then they will investigate and compare with each other by implementing their own mutation, selection, etc., and also tweaking factors such as the population size and number of generations.\n\nI thought it would be cool to provide some sort of history of the fitness graphs, so they can easily see how making such changes impacts the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n\nThese are just my ideas so far, but I would really appreciate any insight or suggestions.\n\nThanks :)",

            "selftext": "Hey all! I'm a computer science student currently studying formal languages for one of my classes and I have a bit of a question regarding Chomksy Hierarchy.\n\nIt's my understanding that each type of grammar is a subset of the type above it. In other words, all type-1 grammars are a subset of the type-0 grammars, type-2 is a subset of type-1, and type-3 is a subset of type-2. However, my confusion stems from the relationship between type-1 (context-sensitive) and type-2 (context-free) grammars. According to my understanding of the Chomsky hierarchy, all context-free grammars (and by extension regular grammars) are context-sensitive as well.\n\nHowever, the definition used for context-sensitive grammar in both the lecture notes and the textbook is that for all production rules, the |LHS| <= |RHS| where LHS and RHS denote the left-hand and right-hand sides of the production rule. This implies that epsilon rules (rules of the type X -> \u03b5 where epsilon denotes the empty string) aren't allowed. However, regular grammars and context-free grammars *can* have epsilon rules, so I'm just a bit confused as to how regular and context-free grammars can be considered context-sensitive as well.\n\nThanks!",

Instead, the network could function using an almost exact, or \u201cclosed-form,\u201d solution that could, in principle, be worked out with pencil and paper. Typically, these nonlinear equations do not have closed-form solutions, but Hasani hit upon an approximate solution that was good enough to use. \"",

So hoping for a mental boost to start thinking about how one could implement various products using LLMs.\n\nAt my extremely minimal knowledge, you would do whatever magic (which I'm currently wondering about in that question) to code an understanding of natural language generally, then get the code to read through Wikipedia (and perhaps do what [LLaMA](https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/) did and read CommonCrawl and such as well, for better language learning). Then now that it has all the data stored somehow in memory, spit it out in JSON.\n\nLarge gaps in that understanding:\n\n1. How the LLM is constructed (the code written by the human trainer).\n2. How to take the nebulous neural network numerical values and pick out the schemas from the model, then pick out the data for those schemas.\n\nThose two things are black boxes to me, hoping for a little insight how it might work.

I think I can set up the problem by creating one source *s^0* with edges to each _s^i_ and one target *t^0* with edges from each *t^i*, and looking to find a flow of *n* from *s^0* to *t^0*.  Does this make sense?  \n\nWhich algorithm would be best for this problem?  I don't really know which algorithm is most efficient for this problem in general (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_simplex_algorithm?), and I know my specific use case would have massively more nodes and edges than in the solution.  Would that mean that a different minimum flow algorithm or pathfinding algorithm is better?\n\nBecause of game details, some nodes change in circumstances (see the \n   \n\n####Factorio details\nFactorio is a game on a cartesian coordinate grid.  It uses conveyor belts to move items from place to place, in any of four directions.  These conveyor belts take up space, and two conveyor belts can't sit in the same spot.  Factorio has undergound belts, that attach to conveyor belts and travel below the ground for up to a certain distance in a straight line.  Underground belts are more expensive (and look less nice), so we try to avoid them when possible (but only if it's not better than normal belts).\n\nNormal belt (S=source, B=belt, U=underground belt start/end, T=target, W=wall or obstruction):\n\n    .SBBBB..    \n    .....B..  \n    .....B..    \n    .....BT.    \n\nUnderground belt\n\n    .SBU.WUB..    \n    .....WBB.  \n    .....WB..    \n    ... .WBT.\n\n\n\nI think this can be graph G=(V,E) where each node is a coordinate on the graph that doesn't already have a building in it, and each node has edges that can be reached by a single belt or underground belt.  One complication is that an underground belt can't turn on the same tile it comes out - it has to continue forward for at least one tile.  I *think* this could be incorporated into the graph, but I'm not sure how.  \n\nThe mod BeltRouter (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BeltRouter) will automatically route conveyor belts for you, using the shortest path.  It even allows you to do multiple belts at once! However, it does these one at a time, so the first path can get in the way of the second path.  I'm looking for ideas on how to solve this.  \n\n\nThank you!  Happy to clarify anything, I appreciate any insight into this.\n\nAs a side note, does anyone know of an easy way to visualize shortest path algorithms that lets you use a custom algorithm, preferably in Python?",

            "selftext": "What a long way we have come. I remember just less than a decade ago I was playing on an old console for the first time. I have been interested in computers ever since. There is just something so nostalgic about old hardware and software. For me it felt like it was a part of me, a part of my childhood, a piece of history, it felt so great to be a part of something revolutionary.\n\nWhen I look at computers now, it amazes me how far we have gotten. But I also feel so far from it, they have reached the level of complexity that all you really care about is CPU speed and RAM and GPU etc... I don't feel the same attachment in understanding what is going as with old computers. CPU speeds so fast and RAM so vast that I can't even comprehend. Back then you knew what almost everything on the computer was doing.\n\nI recently got a 19-year-old IBM ThinkCentre. I had never been with bare metal hardware and the experience felt so amazing. Actually seeing all the hardware, the sounds of the parts and fans, the slight smell of electronics, and the dim light of the moon through the blindfolds. Honestly a heavenly feeling, it all felt so real. Not some complicated magic box that does stuff. When I showed my dad I could see the genuine hit of nostalgia and happiness on his face. From the old \"IBM\" startup logo and using the DOS operating system. He said, \"reminds me of the good old days\". Even though I am only 14 years old, I felt like I could relate to him. I have always had a dream of being alive back in the 1900s, to be a part of a revolutionary era. I felt like my dream came true.\n\nI think what I am trying to get at here is that, back then, most people were focused on the hardware and how it worked and what you can do with it. Now, most people are focused on the software side of things. And that is understandable and makes sense.\n\nI wanna know your opinions on this, does anyone else find the same nostalgia in old hardware as me?",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm struggling finding a motivated answer for this doubt. Briefly, I'm preparing a dataset, which contains x DICOM files for each patient, for training a deep learning model.  Since I want to get all the three planes (i.e. axial, sagittal and coronal) and since each DICOM file is an axial slice, I just process each DICOM file, stack them all creating a volume. From the latter I can divide it to get the three planes.\n\nThe problem is that each patient has different spatial informations (i.e. spacing, number of axial slices). So I have volumes like:\n\n(512, 512, 215) where 215 is the number of slices\n\n(512, 512, 249) where 249 is the number of slices\n\nwith even different spacing. Now, if I do resampling to get the same spacing (e.g. 1mm x 1mm x 1mm) obviously I have a different volume shape for each patient. Inversely, if I resize each volume to same fixed size, I got different spacing for each patient.\n\nMy doubt is: how can I get the correct volume size for a deep learning model considering the spatial information? I thought some options:\n\n1) Resample all the volume to the same spacing 1mm x 1mm x 1mm, then take the three planes individually and resize each one to a target size.\n\n2) Resize all the volume to the same size not considering the spacing.\n\nThe problem with 1) could be handling with the mask, namely dividing the mask volume in the same way.",

            "selftext": "I just finished teaching my AP Computer Science students a series of lessons on algorithms, and I decided to write up a three-part intro series geared towards students and self-taught developers. I know how intimidating this topic can be, so I've been intentional about breaking it down and making it as accessible as possible. If you're new to the field or someone who needs a refresher, this is for you.\n\n# Part One: Expression\n\nCooking a delicious meal, baking a cake, and brewing the perfect cup of coffee all require one key ingredient: a recipe. In the field of computer science, that recipe is an algorithm. Like a recipe, it lays out step-by-step instructions for achieving a specific goal. You can write recipes in many different languages, and you can express algorithms in a variety of ways. Their primary methods of expression include flow charts, pseudocode, natural language, and programming language. Read on for a brief, memorable introduction to each one. \n\n>***algorithm*** *(n.) \u2014 a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.* \n\nImagine you are a busy executive with rules to determine whether you are available for a meeting. There are two parameters at the heart of your rule system: (1) the day of the week and (2) the distance. Given this information, can you generate an algorithm to filter potential meetings? Absolutely.\n\n[availability algorithm expressed as a flow chart](https://preview.redd.it/soaxpqturmga1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0f4300036bde48dfd064f13461c6ae35d6e1630)\n\nThis algorithm ultimately assigns a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d based on your rules. It can help you or your assistant make a decision quickly and easily. If the value of \u201cavailable\u201d is *true* at the end, you will accept the meeting. Otherwise, you will decline. \n\n**Flow charts** provide a visual representation of the algorithm\u2019s logic and flow. Creating them forces you to think carefully about sequencing and selection. *Which arrow goes to what node? Are there missing arrows?* These are invaluable questions that can arise when translating an algorithm into a flow chart, and answering them can lead you to identify potential errors.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to a similar algorithm expressed in **pseudocode**:\n\n[availability algorithm in pseudocode](https://preview.redd.it/l0tma0f1smga1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c70154a532b784150283ab4b6d944227b8c4af7c)\n\nThis algorithm is slightly different, but it accomplishes the same objective by assigning a value of *true* or *false* to the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d based on your rules. Despite its minor differences, it is just as effective as the algorithm depicted by the flow chart.\n\nPseudocode acts as a bridge between natural language and programming language. It allows you to express an algorithm in a way that most people can understand and lets you lay out the algorithm\u2019s logic and flow without worrying about the specific syntax of a programming language \u2014 which makes it easier to test and debug an algorithm before implementing it.\n\nCan we also express this date-availability algorithm in **natural language**? Of course.\n\n1. Create a Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d and set it to false.\n2. Check if the day of the week is a weekday. If it is not, end the algorithm.\n3. Check if the distance is greater than or equal to 20 miles. If it is, end the algorithm.\n4. If steps 2 and 3 are passed, set the Boolean variable \u201cavailable\u201d to true.\n5. End the algorithm.\n\nUsing natural language to express an algorithm makes it relatively easy for people to understand. This advantage is significant because it makes the algorithm easier to share with others, regardless of their technical background.\n\nHow about **programming language**? Definitely.\n\n[availability algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/iqwjmssasmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=557f78fc26721586d254969dde45e3599447756a)\n\nExpressing algorithms in a programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Rust, etc.) allows a computer to execute them directly. There is no need for any interpretation or translation. It also lets you take advantage of the tools and constructs provided by your favorite language. Another advantage is that it allows for automation and performance optimization, which is particularly useful if the algorithm has to be executed frequently or on large data sets.\n\n# Part Two: Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n\nYou\u2019ve learned the basics of algorithms and their modes of expression, but have you ever wondered how they make decisions and control the flow of a program? The answer is **sequencing**, **selection**, and **iteration**. In part two, we\u2019ll delve into how these fundamental concepts shape the functionality of algorithms, making them adaptable, efficient, and powerful tools for solving problems. \n\n**Sequencing** refers to the order in which you execute instructions. An algorithm is a step-by-step process, and it must take each one in the proper order to achieve its goal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejylwfa2tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecd11a2cae4dec6040ebd978af6e4b9a8fb739d1\n\n**Selection** refers to the ability to make decisions based on certain conditions. An algorithm may need to choose between different options based on a given input.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1ced5j4tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf29733f6d882b9a4d9c7985d1fe2a1599c53f66\n\n**Iteration** refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions. It is a part of many algorithms, especially those that involve processing large amounts of data or repeating a task until a condition is met.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9hlp2p6tmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b585f46f181b45e4ee52561df2abd1eb4b5ebd34\n\n**An Example of Sequencing**\n\nThis algorithm designed to calculate the area of a rectangle offers a clear example of **sequencing**.\n\n[calculating the area of a rectangle in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yxowixhmtmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc6e8e0cadc72236739d277dc3b0210fd7aff24e)\n\nNote the importance of order (a.k.a., \u201csequence\u201d) in this algorithm. First, it assigns a value of 3 to the variable *width* and 11 to the variable *height*. Next, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying *width* and *height*. Finally, it prints the result to the console. If you re-arranged these steps, you could stop this algorithm from producing the expected result.\n\nSequencing is vital because algorithms must execute their steps in the proper order. Otherwise, they will not work correctly. Remember, computers can only do what they are programmed to do. So if you program a set of steps in the wrong sequence, a computer will execute them in that sequence \u2014 even if the results are disastrous.\n\n**An Example of Selection**\n\nAn if-else statement to determine whether a number is positive or negative is an example of **selection**.\n\n[a simple selection algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yrcuncfutmga1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5495c4ac2c93363411fa8e2f90b1a21fb26aab4)\n\nIn this example, the algorithm uses an if-else statement to make a decision based on the value of the variable, *number*. If it is greater than or equal to zero, the algorithm executes the first block of code and prints \u201cthe number is positive\u201d to the console. If it is less than zero, the algorithm executes the second block of code and prints \u201cthe number is negative\u201d to the console.\n\nSelection is important because it allows the algorithm to make decisions based on conditions, which makes it more flexible and able to handle a wide range of problems, exceptions, and errors.\n\n**An Example of Iteration**\n\nThis algorithm designed to print the numbers 1\u201310 to the console is a perfect example of **iteration**.\n\n[printing a sequence of numbers in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/gjzhz4j0umga1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4870819f60463e4e4b71187181b4b1dfa65bb7ad)\n\nIn this example, a for-loop repeatedly executes a command that prints the value of the variable *i* to the console. Before it does, it checks a condition \\[\\[ ***i*** **<= 10** \\]\\], and then executes its one command if and only if that condition evaluates to true. As soon as it evaluates to false, the loop will exit, and this simple program will finish running.\n\nIteration matters. It matters because it allows an algorithm to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, which is helpful if you are processing large amounts of data, repeating a task, or generating a sequence of numbers.\n\n# Part Three: Efficiency && Big-O Time Complexity\n\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with sequencing, selection, and iteration, it\u2019s time to take your understanding of algorithms to the next level by exploring the idea that **not all algorithms are created equal**. Some complete their task in a matter of microseconds, while others seem to drag on forever. In part three, you\u2019ll learn about Big-O notation and the difference between reasonable and unreasonable runtime. You\u2019ll also take your first steps towards assessing relative efficiency with an example: linear search versus binary search. This knowledge will lead you to write more efficient algorithms that will set you apart as a developer.\n\n>***Big-O Notation*** *(n.) a formal expression of an algorithm\u2019s complexity in relation to the growth of the input size. It is used to rank algorithms based on their performance with large inputs.*\n\n**Reasonable vs. Unreasonable Runtime**\n\nRuntime is the execution time of an algorithm. In other words, the amount of time it takes to complete its intended task. We can break it into two distinct performance classes.\n\n1. **Reasonable** (a.k.a., \u201cpolynomial\u201d) time describes **any runtime that does not increase faster than n\\^k**. Examples include: constant time (*n\\^0*), logarithmic time (log n), linear time (n), and quadratic time (n\\^2)\n2. **Unreasonable** (a.k.a., \u201csuperpolynomial\u201d) time describes **any runtime that increases faster than n\\^k**. Examples include: exponential time (2\\^n) and factorial time (n!)\n\nThe ability to scale effectively with the size of a given input determines this distinction between *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. Algorithms with *reasonable* runtime have predictable, limited growth in execution time as input size increases. On the other hand, algorithms with *unreasonable* runtime have exponential or even faster growth in execution time as input size increases. It\u2019s crucial to understand the complexities of the algorithm(s) that you\u2019re working with and to strive for reasonable runtime whenever possible so that your programs perform well and scale effectively.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at how some of the most common Big-O runtimes compare in terms of their scaling behavior.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jetr6bvjumga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fce5019c9ead9381dd68600b33ab184ebe82c8d\n\nThis chart goes beyond *reasonable* and *unreasonable*. It analyzes seven different runtimes and rates them from \u201chorrible\u201d to \u201cexcellent\u201d. Note that quadratic time \u2014 **O(n\u00b2)** \u2014 is \u201chorrible\u201d despite its *reasonable* status in traditional computer science circles. This example indicates that there are levels to time complexity analysis and that even if your algorithm is *reasonable*, there may still be room for improvement and optimization.\n\n**Linear vs. Binary Search**\n\n[a linear search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/y85mgvmpumga1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aedbedfcb2cfb3ce0344995dfc659ed2dd1d9830)\n\nLinear search algorithms run in linear Big-O time: **O(n)**. Their execution time is directly proportional to the size of the data set they\u2019re searching.\n\nImagine you have a list of 100 numbers and a linear search algorithm to help you find the one you want. Unfortunately, it\u2019s at the end of the list. So if it takes one millisecond for your algorithm to evaluate a number and determine whether it\u2019s the one you want, you will have to wait 100ms. If you think about it, 100ms is only 1/10 of a second. So your algorithm is fast. Right? Wrong.\n\nReplace your 100-number data set with 1,000,000 numbers. Now how long will you have to wait? Worst-case 1,000,000ms, which is more than 16 minutes. Now we have a problem. The good news is that we also have a solution in binary search.\n\n[a binary search algorithm in JavaScript](https://preview.redd.it/yb5stpzuumga1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=490bd2e0c27076820f8041094aa9cee84f788964)\n\nBinary search algorithms run in logarithmic Big-O time: **O(log n)**, which is exceptionally fast. The catch is that they only work on sorted lists. If you read the code carefully, you\u2019ll see that they work by establishing (*and recursively updating*) a low-index and a high-index in a given array. They find the element halfway between those indices and check to see if it matches the target. If it does, they return the index position of the target. Otherwise, they update the appropriate index and repeat the process.\n\nThis method is remarkably similar to searching for the word *iteration* in a physical dictionary with 960 pages. You would first open it to one of the middle pages and evaluate the words. If they follow *iteration* alphabetically (i.e., they all start with the letter \u201cm\u201d), you know that your target word is in the first half of the dictionary. So, instead of searching through 960 pages, you are only dealing with 480. Remarkable! Now, repeat this process until you find the word *iteration*. This method is a brilliant example of logarithmic time complexity because the amount of time it takes to find the word increases logarithmically with the number of pages in your dictionary.\n\n[ This graph depicts the worst-case execution time of linear and binary search algorithms, assuming \\(arbitrarily\\) that it takes 1ms to evaluate each element.](https://preview.redd.it/54tgt660vmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8efe1357169aa852ef6f56e4768c051a399d6e7)\n\nIf you look closely at the graph, it\u2019s clear that the binary search algorithm is significantly more efficient \u2014 even when dealing with a data set that only contains 100 elements. But what if we were dealing with a data set of 1,000,000 elements? Remember that (worst-case) a linear algorithm takes \\~16 minutes to find its target. On the other hand, a binary search algorithm will only take 19.93 milliseconds. That\u2019s an extraordinary difference! Let\u2019s run one final scenario with 1,000,000,000 (one billion) elements. Working with this massive data set, a linear search algorithm would take more than 11 days to find its target, but a binary search algorithm would only take \\~29.90 milliseconds. Unbelievable. This extreme disparity is why it\u2019s so important to write efficient algorithms.\n\n[ This chart depicts the worst-case execution time of linear and binary search algorithms, assuming \\(arbitrarily\\) that it takes 1ms to evaluate each element.](https://preview.redd.it/e5e26ls6vmga1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6587fd40d5b2a8d1e3bce70cc61efcf14a9bc148)",

            "selftext": "So, a Grey Code is great for machine error reduction, for a variety of reasons. It can really help with communicating between mechanical devices.\n\nBut consider something much more difficult... communicating with *humans*.\n\nHumans don't just make mistakes, sometimes they just plain don't even pay attention! And then, rather than being willing to do any kind of error checking, they'll just assume that their best guess is correct, based on some vague notion of what things 'should' be.\n\nTerrible, simply terrible!\n\nSuppose then, that you are given the opportunity to create a new set of clock tower chimes. You can assume a form of binary for it, because unary is... well, unary.\n\n\\-We'll make the assumption that people will eventually learn them because they are going off every hour from now on. We'll also ignore that phones exist and that no one cares in the slightest about clock tower chimes except for wanting them to be quieter and less annoying-\n\nThe challenge here is to create a code that minimises the odds that a mis-heard chime tells a convincing time. Humans know *sort of* what time it is - it's early afternoon, late evening, etc- but not precisely. As such the code must maximise the odds that a mis-heard chime does not encode a time similar enough to the correct time such that the human becomes confused.\n\nFor 3 bits, I know you can ensure every number is encoded by a bit sequence that differs from one of its neighbours by 2 bits and the other by 3. I haven't gone further than that yet.\n\nSo... does something like this exist as a known coding scheme in a generalised form?",

I have solid/initial knowledge, I learned the basics of computer networks at the university, and I know things like the TCP/IP model, how data transfer is done, how network equipment works, etc. But I would like to perfect it even more. I am very interested in this field and like to educate myself as much as possible. I'm currently working as an RPA developer, which has nothing to do with it at all, but I'd like to move into network security or anything related to networks in the future. I'm much more interested in networking than coding, so I'd like to learn as much as possible. I know about packet tracers, I used them to simulate computer networks, used routing protocols, and the like, but I don't know if simulating some complex network infrastructure would help improve knowledge. Any advice is welcome",

But some time has passed, new resources may have come up and I wanted to ask it on a bigger community.  \n>  \n>Apologies for my bad English!\n\nHi there!\n\nI've been teaching myself how to program for a couple years now. I started out with CS50 and went on to a series of projects. These projects have taught me a lot, but they are mostly practical. I feel that my knowledge of many of Computer Science's topics is still quite limited.\n\nI've become a fan of YouTube videos which explain general aspects of programming. My favorite channels are Computerphile and some of Sebastian Lague's and Tom Scott's videos (especially in the \"The Basics\" series). I have recently discovered Reducible, which is on its way to become one of my favorites, too.\n\nHere are some of the characteristics which make them unique:\n\n* The quality of their content.\n* The beauty of the video (and its animations) - let's exclude Computerphile from this :)\n* They are (mostly) language agnostic.\n* The overall narrative is organized in such a way that it is a pleasure to watch these videos.\n* I can't find a better word for this: these videos are *beautiful*\n\nDo you know of any other such channels? I'm open to other types of resources, too (books, websites, etc.).",

            "selftext": "Hi, not sure if this is the correct subreddit to discuss this so do correct me if not.\n\nIf you haven't heard of smart dust, it's a concept for large amounts of tiny (dust grain sized) autonomous sensor devices to be deployed into an area, carried around by wind, and communicate local sensed events to a device somewhere that aggregates all of the data somehow. I've been reading some papers about the idea, and I want to simulate some different delay-tolerant networking protocols for smart dust.\n\nEvery paper I find either doesn't mention a specific model for smart dust simulation[\\[pdf\\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/313451.313558), or does propose one but explicitly leaves out the motion of the particles, assuming that they remain in static positions[\\[1\\]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11611257_7) [\\[2\\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:MONE.0000048551.54039.f0) [\\[3\\]](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-45209-6_138.pdf). I can see how this is a fair assumption, since nodes close to each other will be carried by similar wind directions and speeds, and will likely stay near each other. These systems may be deployed for a long period of time, though, and they will surely diverge and move around each other.\n\nI'd like to produce a representation of the motion of smart dust particles which is accurate enough to give a rough idea of which protocols work better when movement is considered. There are a few basic ideas I'm considering:\n\n1. Air is a fluid, so use a fluid simulation and move each node according to the air's velocity at its position. This can be difficult to know the parameters to set for the fluid, and also it's tricky to make sure the particles don't just get blown and press up against the edge of the simulation space (which happened when I tried this).\n2. [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), or a modified boids-like algorithm. This would have the properties of nearby particles moving in similar directions and speeds, which I think is true of particles moving in the air. This method would give me better control of particles near the edge of the simulation space, so I can ensure they don't just crash into the side.\n3. Random walk. This seems crude, but would likely produce fairly similar results to the other two.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? Fluid simulation seems the most \"correct\", but I have limited experience setting up such simulations and it seems difficult to get it to behave in a way that seems realistic to me.\n\nThanks!",

It's been a while we haven't made any announcement, but a lot of bugs have been fixed and many new features and libraries have been introduced.\n2. A package manager with a  self-hostable repository for the Blade language authors have finally reached alpha stage. Fully written in Blade and hosted at [nyssa.bladelang.com](https://nyssa.bladelang.com). This is a demonstration of Blade ability to write real-world applications.\n\nPlease check out both the language and the package manager and repository. Contributor and package authors are very much welcomed.\n\nBlade has gone through a lot of improvements since last time and a lot of bugs have been fixed such as:\n\n* Fixed broken exception system.\n* Better error messages that allows navigation from IDE\u2019s such as VS Code, IntelliJ and more.\n* Fixed broken break keyword.\n* Fixed multiple crash bugs on Windows\n* Fixed multiple crash bugs on Linux\n* Fixed multiple crash bugs on macOS\n* Fixed multiline paste error in REPL.\n* Introduced do\u2026while\u2026 statements.\n* In `using` statements, a single when condition can now accept multiple cases.\n* Added support for first-class language-level package management via the `.blade` directory.\n* Introduced default exports and function promotion.\n* Support use of Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`) operators in expression.\n* Fixed crash on/after third instruction from the REPL.\n* Fixed crash with named patterns in regex.\n* New `ast` module for parsing Blade files.\n* Added new `ssl` library\n* Added new `curl` library\n* Added new `colors` library for color conversion and beautiful CLI applications\n* Added new `args` library for working with command-line arguments\n* Added new `iters` library\n* Introduced the `array` module.\n* Introduced `struct` module.\n* Introduced `zlib` module.\n* Introduced `zip` module.\n* Introduced `clib` module.\n* Introduced the `process` module for Unix environments.\n* `string.replace()` can now use a normal string instead of regex in the pattern.\n* `string.index_of()` and `list.index_of()` now accepts second argument that allows us to specify a start index.\n* `to_number()` now handles binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers.\n* Updates and bug fixes to the `http` module.\n* Updates to the `reflect` library.\n\nNyssa is a self-hostable package manager built to support the programming language's growth and fully open source and can be found on Github at [https://github.com/blade-lang/nyssa](https://github.com/blade-lang/nyssa). Nyssa allows you to install, uninstall and restore dependencies from any hosted Nyssa instance. It is both the package manager and repository.\n\nA public version of the repository has been hosted at [nyssa.bladelang.com](https://nyssa.bladelang.com). Though it was down due to some misconfiguration in the reverse-proxy, it is now fully up and alive.\n\nNyssa is written completely in Blade with it's own built-in web server.\n\nThanks",

            "selftext": "This might be a stupid question, for which I am sorry if so.\n\nCould future better performing computers pose security threats?\n\nWe are a very long way away from the sort of computing power I am conjuring up in my head, but it got me thinking\u2026 \n\nLet\u2019s say my current standard PC with 8GB ram, 500GB storage with a Core i5 processor can generate and brute-force around 3,611 random passwords a second, this would equal to around 13,000,000 passwords being brute-forced an hour. This example could still be outperformed today, but just using it as an example\u2026\n\nAll of our passwords have already reached a minimum standard of 8 characters in length which everyone (pretty much) on the planet is already accustomed to. To create enough randomly generated passwords as possible to guarantee cracking just the bare minimum of this standard would require 95^8 passwords (I use 95 as this is the total number of printable characters on a keyboard, which not all passwords will even accept so I\u2019m being generous). As a number that is equal to 6,634,204,312,890,625\u2026\n\nIf my current PC can brute-force 13,000,000 passwords in 1 hour, then for it to get through a guaranteed password cracker of 8 characters it would take around 58,256 years. This isn\u2019t even taking into account the huge amount of storage that would be needed to even host such a large file\u2026\n\nNow let\u2019s jump to the future - the most up-to-date generation are kicking it with their TB ram and hundreds of TB worth of storage, possibly even PB, with super fast performing processing units and graphic cards. Let\u2019s say these computers could brute-force a trillion passwords every second. Well now to get through a guaranteed password cracker of 8 characters would only take just under 2 hours!\n\nIf it ever got to this point, would we have adapted to use stronger passwords longer than 8 characters? I understand some even today will have stronger passwords, but for the majority of the population their passwords are pretty generic and follow the bare minimum of expectations, which is why something like \u2018rock you.txt\u2019 (a file of which is a collaboration of passwords leaked from the site Rock You) is still used today by hackers today to brute-force passwords, and successfully. Unless the way people choose passwords changed drastically, this would pose a huge security threat, in that most of the passwords people use today could be guaranteed-cracked within 2 hours.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m sure methods such as choosing sentences or phrases as a password would increase its character length enough to avoid this situation if everyone jumped on board with it. But for me it raises an interesting question which is how far does this go? How much further can computers go in regards to computing power and where does that leave human based security measurements such as passwords?\n\nTL;DR:\nIf commercial computers get fast enough to crack modern day 8 character minimum passwords quickly, how long can we be expected to remember super long complicated passwords before it causes a problem. How fast can computers get? Could computers get so fast that creating memorable words or phrases for passwords become obsolete?\n\nP.S. For the example I provided, assume the brute-force of a password is being performed locally, trying to crack a hash for an example, not a webpage. I don\u2019t think I know enough about networking to calculate how slower it would make the whole process.",

            "selftext": "My organization does not have a well-organized knowledge base. Instead, the information is spread across thousands of PDF files available online (mostly scanned PDFs) and HTML pages. On top of it, almost daily, many new circulars are added. The areas of the knowledge base vary from civil engineering to accounts to the legal department.\n\nWhat baffles me is that, despite so much progress in computerization, the knowledge we need is not at our fingertips. Every time someone needs information, they either have to ask someone, who will give either a half-cooked reply or an outdated reply. For almost a year, I have been trying to make a system using which I can search for information anytime I need it. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to successfully do it.\n\nI have tried these approaches:\n\n1. Using Evernote to add all the documents and then search in it. But it is crazy slow. Also, due to the constantly adding documents, I am unable to keep it updated. Also, it doesn't show me exactly where the phrase lies in a PDF.\n2. Using OneNote to add snapshots of the documents. It searches well and highlights the phrase too. But again, the constantly adding documents is one problem. Also, I don't know how it will perform on scaling. Right now, I have snapshots of only 100 documents of 1-2 pages.\n3. Using FileLocator Pro. But again, it is not well suited due to regular updates.\n\nMy problem statement is this:\n\n1. Around 20,000 PDF files are available online. No credentials are needed to access them. However, most of them are scanned PDFs.\n2. Many HTML-based knowledge is available.\n3. Many documents that aren't available online, but I will have to scan and upload them.\n4. I want to build a system to search through them and get my answer.\n5. I want fuzzy search. For example, if I search \"Drawing of PTFE neutral section,\" it should come up with the drawing containing these words.\n\nI have heard of Elasticsearch. Maybe it can help. But I am not a coder, so I am not sure. However, if needed, i can learn it.\n\nI just want guidance as to how I can do it efficiently and with the least amount of coding. If I am in the wrong sub, please tell me where to ask it.",

Part of the moral issues that are discussed in these episodes is that it is arguably/probably wrong to torture or otherwise distress these AIs. For a TV show, fine, let's go there for entertainment. But in reality, as a beginner in the tech space, I can't help but feel this would never be the case in real life. I figure any AI, as advanced as it can get, would still just be setting parameters such as this.pain = 100, or this.mood = distressed, or much more complicated versions of this. I'm having trouble imagining code could ever feel pain, making it never morally wrong to do things to these AIs. Thoughts?",

            "selftext": "Before asking my question I need to give a bit of philosophical context. \n\nConsider this expansion of the [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox#Applications_and_related_topics), the barber version:  \n\n1. There are people who don't shave anyone. *(Clients)*\n2. There is a barber who shaves everyone who don't shave themselves. However, the barber is \"confused\" by Russel's paradox. *(Barber^1 )*\n3. There is a meta-barber who **(1)** shaves everyone who don't shave themselves and **(2)** shaves everyone who is \"confused\". This barber is supposedly immune to Russel's paradox. But... who is this meta-barber, can they shave themselves? They can't be a client and they can't be \"confused\" because they have nothing to be confused about. Ironically, the inability to be confused confuses them. They're meta-confused. *(Barber^2 )*         \n4. There is a meta^2 -barber who **(1)** shaves everyone who don't shave themselves and **(2)** shaves everyone who is confused and **(3)** shaves everyone who is meta-confused. But who shaves them? This is a meta^2 -confusion! *(Barber^3 )*  \n5. And so on. \n\nAnd consider this expansion of the [Liar paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox): \n\n1. There are simple propositions which are true or false. But the simple concept of truth leads to \"looping\"  propositions (the liar paradox).  \n2. Let's define \"meta-truth\": it works like simple truth, but marks all looping propositions as meta-true. However, it leads to another paradox: *\"this statement is not meta-true\"*. Whatever value you assign to it (meta-true, meta-false, \"looping\") you get a contradiction. We got \"meta-looping\" propositions.  \n3. Let's define \"meta^2 -truth\": it works like meta-truth, but marks all meta-looping propositions as meta^2 -true. Another paradox: *\"this statement is not meta^2 -true\"*. \n4. And so on.  \n\n...\n\nMy question: is there a similar expansion of the [Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem#Generalization)?  When we try to relax what \"halting\" means (defining \"meta-halting\") and still end up with the same problem. Or is there any other connection to the halting problem? Because the last paradox above deals with inability to \"contain\" a certain type of loops without creating new ones. It also kind of deals with \"running a program on itself\".       \n\nMaybe the last paradox gives an idea for an alternative proof of the halting problem. Like *\"assume all non-halting programs have a property **P** we can notice: if that were the case, we could create more non-halting programs without this property\"*.",

            "selftext": "Hi I wanted to reach out because I think this could be a serious issue for networking and artificial intelligence. Please let me know if I'm missing something important, since I don't have much work experience in technology.\n\nWhen a user requests this address: [https://reddit.com/r/{2022}](https://reddit.com/r/%7B2022%7D)\n\nThe Uniform Resource Identifier will decode to: [https://www.reddit.com/r/%7B2022%7D](https://www.reddit.com/r/%7B2022%7D)\n\nWhy is this serious?\n\nIf one assumes that the encoder parses the URL on a character-by-character basis, then the \"{\" will resolve to \"%7B\" and the \"}\" will resolve to \"%7D\". This will increase the length of the string, aside from the apparent issue that \"/\" may be understood as \"divided by\". But more importantly, the mathematics of \"{}\" may become an issue for networking.\n\nFrom: [https://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/intervals/#:\\~:text=The%20notation%20may%20be%20a,it's%20said%20to%20be%20open](https://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/intervals/#:~:text=The%20notation%20may%20be%20a,it's%20said%20to%20be%20open).\n\nI learned that the parentheses \"()\" are used for \"a < x < b\", and that square brackets \"\\[\\]\" are used for \"a \u2264 x \u2264 b\".\n\nMathematically, while using set notation one would use \"{}\" to denote a set. I think it is a serious issue if set notation cannot be used properly in a web address. Functionally, if the encoder could approach a web address more mathematically, then I think it would be better for machine learning and database applications. Also, I digress to note that \"/\" has been used as a line break, whether in poetry or song.\n\nI'm not sure if this is being resolved in Web 2.0, metaverse, or if programmatically it is easier to just work around. I think it's important for set notation to be valid in web addresses, since the lack of the functionality will probably be detrimental to networking capabilities. I think it would be cool if complex math operations could run at an IPv6 address, not to mention possible changes in data flows.\n\nI hope that mathematics can be more effectively used in web addresses, then the logic and syntax may be more fluid. Maybe it can open up new possibilities for applications.

Hence finally we get the recurrence relation -   \n>  \n>   **f(r) = C(m+r-1, m) \\* C(n+r-1, n) - { f(1) + f(2) + f(3) .. + f(r-1)}**\n\nTranslating to code we can memoize the function f, its prefixSum and even C(m+r-1, m) & C(n+r-1, n)\n\n    f[r] = C(m+r-1, m)*C(n+r-1, n) - prefixSum[r-1]\n    prefixSum[r] = prefixSum[r-1] + f[r]\n    C[m+r-1] = C[m + (r-1) -1]* (m+r-1)/(r-1)\n    C[n+r-1] = C[n + (r-1) -1]* (n+r-1)/(r-1)\n    \n    with initializtions -\n        prefixSum[0] = 0\n        f[1] = 1\n        C[m+1-1] = 1 // C[m+r-1] = C(m+r-1, m)\n        C[n+1-1] = 1 \n\nSo it works in O(k) time, using O(k) auxiliary space.\n\nQuestions - \n\n* Is the solution correct ? \\[Don't know its source so can't verify\\]\n* Are there any optimised approaches?",

            "selftext": " RCU  is a sync mechanism which avoids the use of locking primitives in case  multiple execution flows that read and write specific elements. Those  elements are most of the times linked by pointers and are part of a  specific data structure such as: has tables, binary trees, linked lists  and more.\n\nThe  main idea behind RCU is to break down the update phase into two  different steps: \u201creclamation\u201d and \u201cremoval\u201d \u2014 let\u2019s detail those  phases. In the \u201cremoval\u201d phase we remove/unlink/delete a reference to an  element in a data structure (can be also in case of replacing an  element with a new one). That phase can be done concurrently with other  readers. It is safe due to the fact that modern CPUs ensure that readers  will see the new or the old data but not partially updated. In the  \u201creclamation\u201d step the goal is to free the element from the data  structure during the removal process. Because of that this step can  disrupt a reader which references that specific element. Thus, this step  must start only after all readers don\u2019t hold a reference to the element  we want to remove.\n\nDue  to the nature of the two steps an updater can finish the \u201cremoval\u201d step  immediately and defer the \u201creclamation\u201d for the time all the active  during this phase will complete (it can be done in various ways such as  blocking or registering a callback).\n\nRCU  is used in cases where read performance is crucial but can bear the  tradeoff of using more memory/space. Let\u2019s go over a sequence of an  update to a data structure in place using RCU. First, we just create a  new data structure. Second, we copy the old data structure into the new  one (don\u2019t forget to save the pointer to the old data structure). Third,  alter the new/copied data structure. Fourth, update the global pointer  to reference the new data structure. Fifth, sleep until the kernel is  sure they are no more readers using the old data structure (called also  grace period, in Linux we can use synchronize\\_rcu() \u2014 [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/rcu/tree.c#L3796](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/rcu/tree.c#L3796)).\n\nIn  summary, RCU is probably the most common \u201clock-free\u201d technique for  shared data structures. It is lock-free for any number of readers. There  are implementations also for single-writer and even multi-writers  (However, it is out of scope for now). Of course, RCU also has problems  and it is not designed for cases in which there are update-only  scenarios (it is better for \u201cmostly-read\u201d and \u201cfew-writes\u201d) \u2014 More about  that in a future writeup.",

It's so hard to find motivation to complete these math courses when I can't relate them to high level programming. I could understand the application for simulated physics or something but I just don't see how that will be relevant to my future.\n\nAnyways, I just want some clarification or reading on how closely related these two fields are.

Basically building a language where you can programmatically describe electrical infrastructure hardware components and scale it up by instantiating these hardware models into substations and connecting substations together in a top module to form the local grid. \n\nThe reason behind it is that I see so many repetitive documents being created and I think it would be cool to have it all within a few files in a folder. Like Verilog, it could be compiled and potentially simulate entire grids by solving the power flow equations. \n\nAnother thing I think could be useful is kind of applying different compilers to the system topology. For example, a utility could program a SOP compiler that checks the hardware for NERC compliance and generate files proving electrical system compliance to the regional entity in the area. \n\nIt sounds like a fun project to try and I wouldn't mind getting some other thoughts on it or some help with programming or getting started. \n\nHope this interests some of you.

            "selftext": "I was recently looking into how to structure a DB and create the fastest most efficient system and \"route\" to retrieving data (lots of you guys chimed in on here and I thank you for that!) Anyhow, this brought me to some methods such as cache storage, where your end point could be retrieved and harvested until it is needed (correct me if I am wrong) rather than having to query an offsite DB every time the front end application requests data.  Eventually I was led to look into CPU architecture, and I came to learn about L1 L2 L3 cache, and how L1 cache is fastest, with one reason being that it is closest to the core.\n\nNow, can anyone explain, technically, how the distance between L1 L2 and L3 to the core in this scenario affects the latency?  Is it literally the distance or the fact that L1 and CPU are on the same physical silicon chip (so if L1 L2 L3 were all on the same chip but physically spread further apart, speed would still be equal) ? Does the silicon or specific silicon type affect anything further ?  Does the physical layout affect anything, is there an optimal way to position the components? Also, maybe I am wrong, but does OSI model come into play at all?  If components are not on the same sublayer ( sub layers of physical layer ?) then the use of additional bridge/link that connects to the next component adds certain amount of latency.  Is there anyway to calculate this? Sorry for all the random Q's, i'm just curious. I know nothing about electrical circuit or PCB design\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you",

The reason I would like to take this approach is because I figured that this would reduce processing power, since the program would only have to locate a single file, and then extract the little bit of contents in it with typical schema, but I also figured it would make it easier to store it, migrate it, etc;  Would it make a difference to do this or the other, or does it not matter?
