            "selftext": "hi all! I created a simple free tool where you can summarize and query documents of any size and estimate the cost to do so: [https://www.wrotescan.com](https://www.wrotescan.com/)\n\nYou can edit the prompts as well as automatically chunk and combine documents. There's also a cost estimator for any pdf you upload.\n\nLet me know if you want me to run some examples for you! Send me a pdf and tell me what you'd like summarized or extracted.\n\n***Tips***\n\nPlease be sure to keep *{text}* in both prompts or the program will not input your document's text into the map reduce summarizer.  *{text}* can only appear once in each prompt. It is where the text from each chunk to be summarized is input into the prompts.\n\nCreate a temporary OpenAI key / org to use with this site so you do not have to provide credit card information then be sure to delete the temp key when you are done.\n\n***Learnings***\n\nSome interesting learnings I had while creating the tool:\n\n\\- Minimizing the number of steps through the AI improved summarization, so map reduce was often better than a more advanced refine workflow which passes the output through the model many more times.\n\n\\- LangChain is great for managing multiple step language model calls and bypassing the current limitations of ChatGPT",

You have been given a section of a large set of emails to summarize and come up with an entertaining story.\n\n\\------------------------\n\n**Output**: Once upon a time, there was a group of diplomats working hard to make the world a better place. They had been discussing how to gain leverage over the Pakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue Al-Qaeda. After much deliberation, they decided to use a combination of incentives and coercive measures to try to get the Pakistanis to cooperate. They offered incentives such as increased control over how Kerry-Lugar money was used and increased support for counterinsurgency capabilities. They also used coercive measures such as targeting military leaders who gave support to Al-Qaeda and its allies, and attempting to reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front. In the end, their efforts paid off and the Pakistanis began to cooperate more with their mission. The diplomats had succeeded in making the world a better place.\n\nThe story follows Hillary as she juggles her busy schedule, responding to requests from her colleagues and friends. She is always willing to help, and her dedication to her work is evident. Despite her busy schedule, she is still able to find time to help those around her. A powerful leader was tasked with finding out whether a senator supported the surge in Iraq and obtaining a copy of his recent speech about troops to Afghanistan. The leader reached out to her team for help, and they worked together to draft a memo outlining four strategic interests, three of which overlapped with the leader's goals. With the help of her team, the leader was able to obtain the information she needed and use it to make a positive impact.\n\nPresident Obama was faced with the challenge of how to win the war in Afghanistan without causing too much destruction and civilian casualties. He decided to increase the size of the Afghan army and police force, and to pay them better wages so they could live comfortably. He also decided to send more US Special Forces and tens of thousands of troops to the region. Despite these efforts, the Taliban continued to gain strength and support from the Pashtun community. Obama realized that he needed to find a better solution. He decided to focus on carefully thought out measures such as providing better pay for the Afghan army and police, and using diplomacy to negotiate with the Taliban. In the end, Obama was able to find a peaceful solution that allowed the US to win the war without causing too much destruction.\n\nA Prime Minister of a country had a fear of losing his sight due to a childhood rugby injury. He had his eyes checked and it was found that he had two minor tears in his retina. He visited the world-renowned Moorfields Hospital for further examinations and the doctors decided against any further operations. The Prime Minister was grateful to the doctors and staff of the NHS, especially Moorfields Hospital. Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State was in contact with the Foreign Minister of Honduras to discuss the situation in the country. She asked her staff to call the US Congressman Payne to update him on the situation. Through her diplomatic efforts, she was able to make a positive impact on the lives of many.\n\nA small island nation called Haiti faced many challenges, but the people of Haiti were determined to build a stable, prosperous and democratic future. The United Nations appointed President Clinton as a special envoy to Haiti, and he appointed Dr. Paul Farmer as the Deputy U.N. Special Envoy. Dr. Farmer had dedicated his life to helping the people of Haiti for the past 20 years. Despite the efforts of the U.S., U.N. and other countries, Haiti still faced many challenges. To help the people of Haiti, the U.S. State Department took a closer look at the challenges and Secretary Clinton's chief of staff briefed Members on the initial findings. The U.S. hoped to better target and coordinate assistance, engage the Haitian Diaspora, and make assistance sustainable. To help the people of Haiti, the U.S. proposed granting temporary protected status to Haitians living in the U.S. and included Haiti in security initiatives such as the Merida Initiative. With the help of the U.S., U.N. and other countries, the people of Haiti could build a brighter future.\n\nThere was also a great conflict between two powerful nations, Morocco and Guinea, over a passport that had been taken away from a citizen of Guinea. The leaders of the United States and France stepped in to help and offered ideas to help the two nations come to a resolution, but the leaders of Morocco and Guinea were still unable to come to an agreement. The leaders of the United States and France then decided to meet in Paris to discuss the situation further and were able to broker a deal between Morocco and Guinea, returning the passport to its rightful owner.\n\nThere was also a man named Tom who was nominated for a prestigious position, but his nomination was held up due to a disagreement between two powerful forces. A brave negotiator was able to convince the two sides to lift the hold on Tom's nomination, allowing him to achieve his dream.",

With the help of her progeny, she must battle the darkness and uncover the secrets of the Courier-Express, Nebraska Furniture Mart, See's Candies, World Book, and Kirby. Along the way, she discovers the power of family and the strength of her own courage.\n\nCharlie and Warren stumble upon a mysterious collection of Warren Buffet's shareholder letters. After reading the letters, they discover the existence of a supernatural being, Mr. Market, who offers them mouth-watering opportunities in exchange for their souls. They must battle against Mr. Market and his minions to save their lives and the world.\n\nThe group soon discovers that the company is using dark magic to gain immense wealth and power. With the help of Mrs. B, the 96-year-old founder of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, they must stop the company before it's too late. Along the way, they must battle a ruthless businessman and his henchmen.\n\nWhen a hurricane causes massive losses, primary insurers and reinsurers are left with financial stakes in each loss settlement. Enter Berkshire Hathaway, who offers to write up to $250 million of catastrophe coverage. When rates become attractive, they book a substantial amount of business. But when losses exceed the retained amount, the reinsurers pay 95% of the excess up to its contractual limit, leaving the primary insurer with a financial stake in each loss. With a huge sum on the line, the stakes are high and the horror begins.\n\nThe group soon realizes that the letters contain clues to a mysterious and powerful force that has been manipulating the world's economy for centuries. As they investigate further, they come face to face with a terrifying supernatural entity that will stop at nothing to protect its secrets. With the help of Roberto Goizueta, the former CEO of Coca-Cola, they must find a way to stop the evil before it's too late. Rich Santulli, the CEO of NetJets, is a brilliant executive but also a mysterious figure. When his Aunt Alice asks him if she can afford a fur coat, he replies with a cryptic answer that sets the stage for a horror story.\n\nThe group must decipher the clues and battle the dark forces to save the town and themselves. Along the way, they must face off against Tony, a ruthless businessman who is determined to keep the power for himself. With the help of The Washington Post Company, Wells Fargo & Company, and American Express Company, the group must unravel the mystery and save the town.\n\nTony and Rod, two insurance executives, are tasked with increasing their policy count. When they discover a series of underreported losses, they uncover a sinister plot involving embezzlement and product liability. As they investigate further, they realize the losses are connected to a mysterious figure from the past. With the help of John, Tom, Michael, Don, and Don, they must unravel the secrets of the past before it's too late.\n\nFinally, the group discovers that their investments have unleashed a supernatural force. As they try to stop the force, they must battle the mysterious entity and its minions in a race against time to save the world from destruction. With the help of Jim Kilts, the former CEO of Gillette, they must find a way to stop the evil before it destroys them all. With twists and turns that keep viewers in suspense until the end, this horror film will captivate its audience. Will they be able to save the world before it's too late? With their lives on the line, they must fight to uncover the truth and save the world from the dark force. Will they make it out alive?",

This framework should incorporate a combination of logical and causal theories, such as features and fluents, motivated action theory, state-based minimization in the event calculus, and causal theories. These theories should be able to handle continuous time, concurrent actions, and various kinds of ignorance, and should support retrodiction, prediction, and plan verification. The framework should also be able to deal with the ramification problem, by incorporating static laws that relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes. Additionally, it should be able to reason about the attitudes of other agents, and to understand narratives and diagnose faults in physical devices. To achieve this, a combination of logical AI, non-monotonic logics, and probabilistic reasoning must be used.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe theory of mind for the singularity emphasizes the importance of representation in mental states, formal syntactic description, and content externalism. It is based on enactivism, extended mind, and Leibniz's theory of mind, and incorporates insights from natural language semantics, Bayesian belief networks, and the general theory of event causality. It should also consider the implications of uncertainty, non-monotonic reasoning, and qualitative spatial reasoning. It should be able to handle the complexities of temporal reasoning and the frame problem, and should account for the effects of actions and the persistence of caused propositions.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind are identical to states and processes of the brain, and the Turing Test is a proposal by Alan Turing to answer the question of whether machines can think. The theory of mind for the singularity is that machines can think and possess intelligence, but that they are not conscious in the same way as humans. Machines can process information and make decisions, but they lack the ability to experience qualia, or subjective experiences. The theory of mind for the singularity is that it is a higher order awareness, a perception of one part of (or configuration in) the brain by the brain itself. This awareness is a special sense, different from that of bodily sensation, in which we become aware of parts of our brain.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe theory of mind for the singularity emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between humans and machines, and how they can work together in harmony. This framework should include a recognition of the unique capabilities of each, and a respect for the autonomy of both. It should also recognize that machines can be used to augment human capabilities, and that machines can be used to help humans reach their full potential. To pass the Turing Test, the machine must be able to understand and respond to questions in a way that is indistinguishable from a human. Ultimately, the theory of mind for the singularity suggests that intelligence is not limited to any one form or type of computation, but is instead a universal phenomenon that can be found in any system that is capable of learning, adapting, and responding to its environment.\r  \n\\------------------------ \r  \n**Input:** \r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/search/search?query=artificial+intelligence\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modularity-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-externalism/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/\r  \n\r\r  \n\\------------------------ \r  \n**Prompts:** \r  \n*Map*\r  \nInstructions: I want you to act as a philosopher.
