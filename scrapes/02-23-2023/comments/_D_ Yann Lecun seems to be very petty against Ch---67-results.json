            "selftext": "I get that he is one of the *godfathers* of AI. Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.\n\nLately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples\n\n*\"By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.\"*\n\n*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.\n\n*\"Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.\"***\n\n***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)\n\n*\"It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,\" the computer scientist said. \"It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.\"*\n\n\\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*\n\n*\"my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.\"*\n\n\"*I'm trying to correct a \\*perception\\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.\"***\n\n\"*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.\"*\n\n\"*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.\"*\n\nHe also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.\n\nTo say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. \n\nIt's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.\n\nIt's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data. \n\nInventing combustion engine is just as important as putting it in the car.",
