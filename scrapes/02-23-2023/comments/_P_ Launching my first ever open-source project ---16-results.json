Catch edge-cases and outliers to help them refine their models\n3. Allow them to customise the tool according to their needs (hence, open-source)\n4. Bring data-security at the forefront (hence, self hosted)\n\nYou can check out the project https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain and would love to hear feedback from the community",
