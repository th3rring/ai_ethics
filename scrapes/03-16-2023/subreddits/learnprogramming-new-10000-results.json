I have found this subreddit pretty useful for giving me some type of direction, however there is a lot out there. I've narrowed it down to either The Odin Project or FullStackOpen. I haven't seen any posts that are mostly personal experiences with either learning curriculum. I thought it might be useful for everyone exploring software development  to have a thread where they can see how everyone else did while they were in these free mostly on your own type of learning programs.\n\nexample:\n\nprogramming experience: New Learner or Experienced Developer ( years 3 in Kotlin )\n\nFullStackOpen Experience: I had a good experience with full stack open.

I already saw an almost identical question to mine, probably asked by another student who is developing the same project i'm doing, but since i'm not in contact with him i have to make another question for a similar but different problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy idea is to have a dashboard:\n\n\\- on the left pane, it should have the buttons for the various functionality (organizing a menu, or inserting a notice for employees) and must always be displayed. When you click a button, a node gets added to the central pane.\n\n\\- on the central pane, there's the node for the functionality.\n\n\\- on the right pane, there should be an additional node for nested functionality. For example, on the central pane there could be a button \"show all dishes\" that should load another node for additional information on the right pane, without closing the central one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also using an MVC pattern. Right now, this is what i made:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    **Homepage View**\n    \n    public class Homepage {\n    \n    private Stage stage;\n    private Scene scene;\n    private Parent root;\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n    launch(args);\n    }\n    \n    u/Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {\n    \n    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Homepage.class.getResource(\"/homepage/homepage.fxml\"));\n    Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlLoader.load());\n    stage.setTitle(\"Hello!\");\n    stage.setScene(scene);\n    stage.show();\n    \n    \n    }\n    \n    public void openHomepageGUI(ActionEvent event) throws IOException {\n    root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(\"/homepage/homepage.fxml\"));\n    stage = (Stage)((Node)event.getSource()).getScene().getWindow();\n    scene = new Scene(root);\n    stage.setScene(scene);\n    stage.show();\n    }\n    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n    **Homepage controller**\n    `\n    public class HomepageController {\n    private SendNoticeGUI sendNotice = new SendNoticeGUI();\n    private ManageMenuGUI manageMenu = new ManageMenuGUI();\n    \n    \n    u/FXML\n    BorderPane borderPane;\n    \n    public void clickSendNoticeButton(ActionEvent event){\n    try {\n    borderPane.getChildren().remove(borderPane.getCenter());\n    borderPane.setCenter(sendNotice.openSendNoticeGUI(event));\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n    throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n    \n    }\n    \n    public void clickManageMenuButton(ActionEvent event){\n    try {\n    borderPane.getChildren().remove(borderPane.getCenter());\n    borderPane.setCenter(manageMenu.openManageMenuGUI(event));\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n    throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n    \n    }\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    **Send Notice View**\n    public class SendNoticeGUI{\n    \n    private Stage stage;\n    private Scene scene;\n    private Parent root;\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n    launch(args);\n    }\n    \n    u/Override\n    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws IOException {\n    FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Homepage.class.getResource(\"/sendNotice/send-notice.fxml\"));\n    Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlLoader.load());\n    stage.setTitle(\"Hello!\");\n    stage.setScene(scene);\n    stage.show();\n    }\n    \n    public Node openSendNoticeGUI(ActionEvent event) throws IOException {\n    return FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(\"/sendNotice/send-notice.fxml\"));\n    \n    }\n    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis actually works as intended without any problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this case, the controllers are not connected to each other (i've never seen someone do it). Only the HomepageController is connected to every GUI, thus having access to every \"openXGUI\" method which loads a node and returns it, so that the borderPane can use it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in my Manage Menu functionality things change a bit: it is the case i listed before where i want additional infos. When it gets added on the central pane, it also has a button called \"Add New Dish\", which should open another node on the right pane where there's the form to create a dish. I should be able to have both panes opened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is i cannot do this without connecting the ManageMenuController to the HomepageController: the 'action listener' for the 'Add New Dish' button is located in ManageMenuController (not in the homepageController like before), so it cannot see the borderPane variable stored in the homepageController.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the Manage Menu Controller code to help you visualize better my problem:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    public class ManageMenuController {\n    \n    private ManageMenuGUI manageMenu = new ManageMenuGUI();\n    \n    private NewDishGUI newDish = new NewDishGUI();\n    \n    \n    public void clickNewDishButton(ActionEvent event){\n    \n    /* Here's the problem. I don't have access\n    to the borderpane variable, since its\n    located in the HomepageController.\n    I should add it to the right pane of that borderpane, but i can't.\n    \n    I tried loading the homepage.fxml file, so i can\n    have access to its controller using the getController() method.\n    */\n    \n    FXMLLoader rootLoader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/homepage/homepage.fxml\"));\n    rootLoader.load();\n    HomepageController hmc = rootLoader.getController();\n    hmc.setBorderPaneRight(newDish.openNewDishGUI());\n    \n    // the openNewDishGui() method simply loads the node and returns it, so that it can be added to the pane.\n    }\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way i tried here doesn't work. When i call the 'hmc.setBorderPaneRight(newDish.openNewDishGUI())' nothing happens, it doesn't add the right pane to the homepage's borderpane (i searched online and i found that using the getController() method should just return the controller already loaded with the FXMLLoader of the homepage's gui, but since nothing happens when i press the button, i think i'm not referring to the SAME INSTANCE i already loaded? I don't know).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking the borderPane in homepage controller 'static' is not the right way because loaded FXML files don't work with the 'static' keyword.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo i thought to simply instantiate an HomepageController inside ManageMenuController, thus seeing the borderPane variable, but i also see this as wrong: it would create two HomepageControllers, and i don't think it is good programming, and i also think it could cause troubles since i'm operating on a different instance of the borderPane variable. This would also connect two controllers to each other (and i'll say it again, i've never ever seen someone do this).\n\nI'm lost. I'm not sure i'm using the right approach, but it is working and seems pretty clean. I'd like to solve this issue. Any help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Asking for direction and advice.\n\nHey, all!  \n\nI know this is a bit of a broad request for information, but specifically, I'm trying to go into this without being completely blind.  Any advice on what to research or look up is more than appreciated. \n\nI just want a little advice or guidance to get started.  A little background before I ask:  I'm fine with HTML, CSS (rusty, but get it), Python, PHP (New to it but comfortable with logical/OOP), C++, SQL, I've not worked with Javascript hardly at all, but I'm fairly confident I can figure out the basics of what I need to do.  \n\nI'm wanting to help my dad with his business by creating and hosting a website for him. He has a recreation center that he rents our for parties and family entertainment  I have a couple servers and a few available static IP's.  I'm hosting two websites on the servers already (personal use.  One is for a discord bot, the other is for a game server management system).\n\nBasically, the website would need some basic information, a calendar with available dates for openings, and some photos. \n\nLater on, I'd want to add a payment system so people can book times and submit their payment online - at that point we'd move on to hosting elsewhere most likely, for better security.  \n\n\nSome of the thoughts or concerns that I have initially are: \n\nWhat to do about refunds if someone cancels.  I get that you would outsource payment to something like PayPal, Square, etc... Do they handle refunds or do we?  \n\nAre there any email softwares to host an email server with the domain name, or does that HAVE to be paid for to the domain registrar?  \n\n\nI'm debating on SQLite or Postgres depending on where we might need to access the database.  If I understand correctly, SQLite wouldn't need any extra open ports which should mean better security, but also gives us less access to the DB when necessary.\n\nAre there any other questions, concerns, issues, etc... that I'm missing?  \n\nAs far more experienced devs than myself, what are the first thoughts you have when running a project such as this?\n\nSomething I want to mention as well, I know this is probably something easily achievable through squarespace or WordPress (which,  I'll probably use WordPress to get the initial site/placeholder up), but I really want the practice and experience this can offer, which is why I'm asking for the advice.  \n\nAddendum: To be transparent, I posted almost this exact same thing in r/webdev, but didn't include that it's for experience as well, not just the finished product, and I was pushed towards Squarespace or Bluehost, which is understandable, but I'd like some insight for the building experience.",

I initially gave myself 6 months to launch some type of portfolio, which I did, but only with html/css. I quickly learned I needed more in todays market and jumped in head first to JavaScript. After months of endless tutorials something finally clicked. Then I discovered that wasn\u2019t enough either and I needed to learn React and apis, which again I did. That\u2019s where I find myself now, I\u2019m comfortable enough now to transfer and recreate my initial projects into react, I haven\u2019t relaunched  my portfolio yet but idk I have this constant feeling of dread that whatever I do will never be enough to get a job.

I know it's a bit of a neglected language, but I really needed to be able to solve this problem.\n\nI was watching some videos and noticed that most people have a \"tab\" called ***triggers***. I am not referring to the option with the \"ray\" symbol next to the properties, I understand that they may have the same purpose, but they work in different ways.I looked a lot about how to find this tab, some places said that I should create a WPF (.net) app project, even the videos themselves said the same, and I did, but I still can't find this option.\n\nIf anyone can help me I would be extremely grateful.In advance, thank you.\n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/a/Q32vJib ",

I've read some articles about LLM (Huge respect to Stephen Wolfram), I know the basics of machine learning, but I can't DO things to show my value.\n\nLike, when I was learning webdev, I learned HTML/CSS, then JS, then I learned how to set up a servers and databases and finally how to use a popular framework. Put some projects in my portfolio, learned the best practices and ta-da, I was ready to being forced participate in meaningless meetings while trying to actually put some work in the meantime (jk :P).\n\n\nBut now my problem is how do I gain \"marketable\" experience with AI? Specially LLM? I can't make a \"homegrown/garage\" GPT project like I could do with sites (or can I? I'd love to know). The tip that is always told to lost software enginneers is \"just start building\", but I am so lost that I can't even find the resources to start learning how to build. Everything that i search for always lands me on some guy making a pretty UI with an API in the background doing the actual magic. I want to be the one doing the magic.\n\n\nThanks for reading until here, I'd love guidance.",

I have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and in this project one of the most important requirements is using frameworks (you are supposed to learn them all by yourself obv. there is no help from the uni whatsoever). I have been having trouble choosing a language and a framework for the backend because I'm not sure what would be a little more beginner friendly. I was thinking of doing PHP with Laravel, but I was told that it is not very demanded in the industry. What is recommended by the professors is C# with .NET, but then again I'm not sure if that would be practical for me.\n\nI know enough Java, and that has sort of created a comfortability with starting to learn new languages.\n\nSo I guess to sum it up, I'm looking for a guide as to what JS Library, backend language and framework I should use.\n\n*I'll also add that I want to use SQL for the database",

We shall gather on a Discord server for now, since it is easy to set up and join.\n2. We shall build open source Haskell projects, all together or in small groups, starting with something easy and going upwards from there.\n3. We shall peruse technical literature as needed.\n\nSo, this is kind of like internship, but for free and open source.\n\n## Who am I?\n\n* Have been learning Haskell and Software Engineering by myself on the Internet.\n* [This is my most recent open source pull request.][1]\u2002Dig in for more.\n* [This is my profile on Stack Overflow.][2]\u2002_(Abandoned since the Monica event.)_\n* Moderator of /r/CategoryTheory.\n* Get paid to write commercial PostgreSQL\u2013Haskell\u2013PureScript software.\n* From a far land, no formal education, avoid speaking of gender, ethnicity and religion.\n\n### Why am I doing this?\n\n* I want to pay it forward.\u2002No one taught me, but many helped a little at a time, so I still morally owe some teaching to the world.\n* There is plenty of places on the Internet to ask specific questions and illuminate small spots of knowledge.\u2002But there are few if any ways to build a personal connection with someone who will care about your growth over a length of time.\u2002I needed this and it was not there.\u2002I want it to be there for others.\n* Shared projects and interests inspired me before.\u2002I am hopeful that more inspiration will come this way.\n* Remember those academic publications I mentioned?\u2002I learned some stuff, but there is still so much waiting ahead for us to conquer together.\n\n## Who are you?\n\n* You want to become a strong software engineer.\n* You can put an hour a day for a year to it.\u2002[I do not say _\u00abten years\u00bb_.][3]\u2002But some commitment is needed.\n\n**before you ask** \u2002 \u2014 Do I need to know Haskell, other language, Mathematics, before I show up?\u2002\u2014 No, you only need commitment.\u2002Everything else will come.\n\n### Why would you be doing this?\n\nYou tell me!\n\nEven reading one technical book on a new topic takes weeks, months.\u2002Learning a whole new language, or a new trade, takes longer.\u2002At the same time, online study groups tend to exponentially decay with the half-life of about a week.\u2002For this setup, I want the decay to be slower.\n\nThis is why I ask an upcoming fellow to send me a personal mission statement.\u2002It is not hard; you can look examples up on the Internet.\u2002I shall never share it with anyone.\u2002You can change your mind at any time.\u2002I only want everyone to have some express commitment from the outset.\n\n* * *\n\nComment with your questions, I shall try to answer.\n\nLike, share, and see you there!\n\n[1]: https://github.com/haskell-game/tiny-games-hs/pull/110\n[2]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/2108477/ignat-insarov\n[3]: https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html\n[4]: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200003164",

The problem is, I came up with part of the code by gathering bits and pieces from the Web.\n\nI understand the most of it, but I don't feel comfortable explaining it to someone else. Which I'd love to be able to.\n\nBefore pointing out which particular lines are confusing me, let me paste the snippets:\n\nheader\n\n    class LinkedList {\n    private:\n      struct Node {\n        int m_data{0};\n        Node *m_next{nullptr};\n      };\n      Node *m_head{nullptr};\n      int m_current_size{0};\n    \n    public:\n      LinkedList();\n    \n      void insert(int value);\n    \n      void print();\n    \n      ~LinkedList();\n    };\n\nsource\n\n    LinkedList::LinkedList() = default;\n    \n    void LinkedList::insert(int value) {\n      Node *temp{new Node};\n      temp->m_data = value;\n      temp->m_next = m_head; //I have doubts about this line\n      m_head = temp;\n      ++m_current_size;\n    }\n    \n    void LinkedList::print() {\n      Node *temp{m_head};\n      while (temp != nullptr) {\n        std::cout << temp->m_data << ' ';\n        temp = temp->m_next;\n      }\n      std::cout << '\\n';\n    }\n    \n    LinkedList::~LinkedList() { //and about the whole constructor\n      Node *temp{nullptr};\n      while (m_head != nullptr) {\n        temp = m_head;\n        m_head = m_head->m_next;\n        delete temp;\n      }\n    }\n\nIn class function insert(int value) there is a line:\n\ntemp->m\\_next = m\\_head;\n\nFrom what I understand inserting new node will make that node point to nullptr to indicate this is the last node in the list. So can I replace the above line with:\n\ntemp->m\\_next = nullptr; ?\n\nThe second thing. The destructor completely blows my mind and I didn't expect it to actually work. But after explicitly calling it with \\`example.\\~LinkedList();\\`, nodes are indeed destroyed. How deleting temp which is just temporarily assigned with m\\_head frees up the memory? From what I see it shouldn't influence the nodes in any way.",

Its an app that uses leaflet where I can input values into a form and it'll log a workout.  I had tested that it worked up until I introduced a way for it to push the workout into an array.  Now when I input correct values into my form, it still thinks that it's a negative value and I dont know why.  I have double checked the helper function and guard clause (as thats where i think the issue is) but I dont see where i messed it up.

What is the correct way of creating array on top of another? (the union has to be created with [0] elements to compile, obviously i am abusing them)\n\nNow another example, if i want to forward a pointer of different type of array into the said method.\n```\nvoid test (uint16_t test[10]) {\n    sendarr(test);\n}\n```\n\"cast from pointer to integer of different size\".

The class takes in a cell object as input and does three things:\n\nFirst, note that the PetriDish class contains a dictionary called self.world, which is a mapping of a petri dish coordinate to a symbol of cell occupying that space. Use the x,y coordinate information in the cell to populate the petri dish map with the symbol of the cell.\n\nSecond, the PetriDish also has a list of cells called self.all\\_cells, which it uses to keep track of all the alive cells. The new cell needs to be added to this list.\n\nFinally, as a preventative measure, the petri dish needs to keep track of all the free positions on the petri-dish. This is done via the self.available\\_positions list. This list contains a list of all the positions that are currently free. When the petri-dish is created, this is completely full, with all the possible positions the petri-dish can take.

I'm in college, yes, but the only things taught were things I learned before college (syntax, logic, OOP, etc...).\n\nI am close to a full-stack developer. I'm extremely fluent with managing servers, PHP (including HTML & CSS, little jS), SQL, and recently I've began \"learning\" C#. I say  \"learning\" because it's very similar to PHP, I haven't really soaked in a lot. I have, however, created a windows forms desktop application with an embedded database. A password manager. I also started on an enterprise management tool, but threw it away since I want small projects for now.\n\nIn PHP, I developed an admin panel that functions as an enterprise management tool. It can send e-mails, fill in PDF forms (referencing pre-configured form fields from a database, which auto-fills with users data also stored in the database) and mail merge them, has a user management system (roles, permissions, etc..), pulls the weather from an API and returns operational suggestions based off of it. The PDF/Email things are through libraries, which is a gripe of mine (I want to know how to code that stuff myself). I was also able to reverse engineer the algorithm for generating usernames and temporary passwords that my college uses, without seeing the code.\n\nEven with this, I still feel like a Novice. I feel like I'm deathly behind the curve. I don't know what Big O notation is, or stuff like that. I don't have much formal knowledge of coding, just how to apply it. How can I round-off these skills and gain a more formal knowledge of them so that I am closer to a professional programmer?",

            "selftext": "\n\nI tried to make a calculator work in React Native. What I quickly  realized there was a noticeable delay from button press to the value  being displayed. On every inputted value the state changes, causing a  re-render of the whole component. So far this is expected, but I don't  want to have to re-render every single button in the Calculator  component. If I press on one button I don't feel like all the other  buttons should also have to re-render. since this doubles the rendering  time of the calculator, causing a noticeable delay from button press to  the number being displayed. How can I fix this?\n\nIn profiler it says that the Buttons re-render because the onPress  changed. This would be the handleSymbolPress. I tried to use useCallback  on it, but it didn't work, I assume it was because calculation is  changed every time the function is called. The only way I could prohibit  the re-render of these buttons was to use useCallback with an empty  dependency on the individual buttons themselves. This didn't either  work, the inputted values just kept overriding the old inputted value. I  assume this is because the useCallback hasn't access to the updated  calculation state. Adding calculation as a dependency to that  useCallback would cause them all to re-render just as I don't want them  to do.\n\nSo, is there a way to make this work, to only re-render the Button that is actually being used? How should I go about this?\n\nI tried looking at examples at GitHub but several of those I checked were as slow as the one I have.\n\nI appreciate any help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    import { Dimensions,

I got a toaster PC (imo) but it can run VS and other stuff. Seen a lot of comments to try Linux so I might switch my OS to Linux entirely or dualboot, unsure which.\nAnyways, thanks again :)\n\nEDIT 2: Hi, again thanks for the support and advice. Current goal is to finish CS50 and then get into other Harvard courses etc to expand. Probably do ODIN to get JS/RUBY experience and maybe Python alongside it too.\nI am currently finishing German equivalent of Highschool but it will take me a year or two longer than expected to get into a college (Germany requires something called \"Abitur\") as I was sick for a year and had to repeat a year, otherwise im a good student and maths etc that matter for CS shouldn't be hard considering my mom is a math major",

            "selftext": " I'm receiving data via a react-router-dom loader function. Every time I visit the /alerts route, the loader fires and returns data retrieved via a GET request.\n\nI then take this data and access it via the react-router-dom useLoaderData() hook in the components that rely on that data.\n\nI then wanted to set up context so I could store the array of data in state and pass it through the app. I'm encountering a problem where essentially an infinite loop occurs because I suspect the following is happening:\n\n1. Data retrieved via loader when accessing the /alerts route\n2. Data accessed via useLoaderData() and used in a child component\n3. When accessing alerts, loader fires, returns data, sets state with data, state requires a re-render, loader fires, returns data, sets state with data, state requires a re-render and so on causing a loop.\n\nIs there any way I can implement context with React Router loader data? Isn't the data going to be unique every time it's returned from the axios GET request?\n\nHere's my context provider code:\n\n    import { useReducer } from \"react\";\n    \n    import AlertsContext from \"./alerts-context\";\n    \n    const defaultAlertsState = {\n      alerts: [],\n      activeAlert: {},\n    };\n    \n    const alertsReducer = (state, action) => {\n      if (action.type === \"ALERTS\") {\n        const updatedAlerts = action.alerts.filter((alert) =>\n          !state.alerts.some((al) => alert.id === al.id)\n        );\n    \n        return {\n          alerts: [...state.alerts, ...updatedAlerts],\n          activeAlert: updatedAlerts[0],\n        };\n      }\n    \n      if (action.type === \"ACTIVE\") {\n          const selectedActiveAlert = state.alerts.find(alert => alert.id === action.alert.id)\n    \n        return {\n            alerts: state.alerts,\n            activeAlert: selectedActiveAlert\n        }\n      }\n    \n      return defaultAlertsState;\n    };\n    \n    const AlertsProvider = ({ children }) => {\n      const [alertsState, dispatch] = useReducer(alertsReducer, defaultAlertsState);\n    \n      const setActiveAlert = (alert) => {\n        dispatch({ type: \"ACTIVE\", alert: alert });\n      };\n    \n      const setAlerts = (alerts) => {\n        dispatch({ type: \"ALERTS\", alerts: alerts });\n      };\n    \n      const alertsContext = {\n        alerts: alertsState.alerts,\n        activeAlert: alertsState.activeAlert,\n        setAlerts,\n        setActiveAlert,\n      };\n    \n      return (\n        <AlertsContext.Provider value={alertsContext}>\n          {children}\n        </AlertsContext.Provider>\n      );\n    };\n    \n    export default AlertsProvider;\n\nAnd here's the component I'd like to call the setAlerts and setActiveAlert functions from context to store the array of data and active alert in state. I can't do this, as far as I can tell, because setting state via context will require a re-render of the components consuming the context state, and those components live on the /alerts route, which on rerender triggers the loader that fetches data again, so the data returned from useLoaderData() is new, sets state again, and the loop goes on.\n\n    import { useLoaderData } from \"react-router-dom\";\n    \n    import AlertBody from \"./AlertBody\";\n    import AlertQueue from \"./AlertQueue\";\n    \n    import classes from \"./Alerts.module.css\";\n    \n    const Alerts = () => {\n      const alertData = useLoaderData();\n    \n      return (\n        <div className={classes.alertsContainer}>\n          <AlertBody alertData={alertData} />\n          <AlertQueue alertData={alertData} />\n        </div>\n      );\n    };\n    \n    export default Alerts;\n\nI'd be super appreciative if someone can offer a possible solution!

It all started when I kept on struggling to stay awake during my hour and a half commute to and from work. I wondered how I could fix this (other than pulling over) and came up with a cool programming project for myself. I understand it\u2019s pretty big but I feel like it\u2019s something I\u2019m really motivated towards and I\u2019d love to be able to succeed in it.\n\nEssentially, I want to build a wrist device that will vibrate when I close my eyes. I have an idea that it\u2019ll be two devices.\nThe first will be a camera that will go on my windshield and faces me. I was looking into having it run facial recognition and using that to determine when my eyes are closed/open or when my head drops. This would then send a signal to the second device.\nThe second device is going to be a silicone band that goes around your wrist. It\u2019ll have the hardware required to receive the signal from the first device and vibrate/lightly shock the user. \n\nThat\u2019s essentially that plan and I\u2019d like to include other things in the future like adjustable vibration intensity, being battery-operated and rechargeable, and possibly even an app in the future but right now I just want to get it to work together.\n\nI\u2019d love to do my own research on this but being new to the programming world, I have no  idea of the kind of hardware I would need to make this happen. If someone could just give me an idea of what topics and components I\u2019ll need to learn about, it would help me out a lot! I appreciate you reading and I hope y\u2019all have a wonderful day!",

I don't feel like I need more answers, but if you think there's some additional info that may help others, please feel free to comment :)\n\nHi r/learnprogramming,\n\nI'm taking an intro to web dev course that has been getting us to build basic pages using structural elements like header, nav, article, section, aside, footer, etc. We are now getting to the CSS part of the course, and it's asking us to use tags like div and class. The lecture material has gone over what they do and how they're different (i.e. class is used for any repeated element that we want styled the same, id is for unique sections), but hasn't explained how to use them. I'm struggling to understand the *how* and the *why* behind them when we have structural elements that can also be styled with CSS too\n\nDo I replace the structure elements with div/class tags?\n\nAm I wrapping structural elements with div/class tags?\n\nOr are they essentially replacing them? Is there a benefit to this?\n\nFor example is\n\n    <header>\n        <h1>This is a header</h1>\n    </header>\n\ndifferent to this in some way?\n\n    <div id=\"header\">\n        <h1>This is a header</h1>\n    </div>\n\nor is the best practice something like this? It seems redundant to wrap a header tag with a div tag?\n\n    <div id=\"header\">\n        <header>\n            <h1>This is a header</h1>\n        </header>\n    </div>\n\nIf almost all structural elements are easily replaced with div and class tags, why do we have structural elements at all?\n\nSorry, I know this is a super noob question but I'm struggling to find an answer to it that explains it clearly. I've checked out w3 schools which is the resource my course points us towards when we're stuck, but I haven't found it helpful in this case.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n**Please ELI5 why div/class elements seem to replace structural elements when both can be styled with CSS.**",

            "selftext": "Im a 31 year old male. I have a BA in Communications. Been working in market research for about 3 1/2 years now and Im not really liking it. Ive also been teaching music for the last 10 years along with producing/writing music for the last 2 years. Been playing since I was 14, play multiple instruments, been in bands, recorded records, played live, recorded people, etc. I love music\n\nI feel that Im at a crossroads with my life career wise. Im not the biggest fan of my current market research job and not sure if I wanna continue to move up. Currently a project manager at a company and I feel that Ive hit a ceiling. I love playing and making music and within the last few years Ive gotten even better. I ultimately want to make that my career but its hard to pay the bills when youre starting out FT and I dont have a partner to lean on for finances. Its something I loved doing as a kid and couldn't imagine my life without it\n\nIve been thinking about learning coding so I can rely on having a great skill, great pay to where I can live without a GF and the luxury of potentially working from home. Ive done some free tutorials online for HTML to see if Id understand/like it and so far Im digging it. Ive gotten to the point where I wanna learn more coding languages and view it as a great educational challenge rather than a chore. As of right now I am still looking more into this field so I apologize if Im coming off as naive.\n\nI wanted to ask on here to see what would be an ideal path(s) to take to be able to get educated/certified in coding and land a job. Ive been looking into coding bootcamps and that seems to be the best option with my current lifestyle. Wasn't sure if there is a particular one I should look into or if I should go back to school. Hoping to see if anyone who has been through a coding bootcamp can give some insight on how intense and hard coding bootcamps are. Also wanted to ask if theres anything I can do to see if I for sure will like or hate coding for a living so it can help guide me to an answer\n\nAlso wanted to ask what the work/life balance is for a coder. Essentially my goal is to work 40hrs a week and dedicate the rest of my time to making music. Wasnt sure if its a field where its realistic to make a good living working only 40hrs or be working overtime constantly. I dont think I want to get a crazy high paying job to where my whole life is dedicated to coding as I have other interests I want to pursue and this would help me be able to make a great living and attain a great skill set to help fund my passions and pay bills. In my head, if I can make $75K a year, Ill feel accomplished (not sure if thats realistic).\n\n***TL;DR*** \\- At a crosswords career wise. Want to learn coding but not sure how to go about it and what to do for degree/certification. Want to know how hard coding bootcamp is, work/life balance as a coder. If everything lines up, wants a coding job to have a good living to help pursue passions",

[THIS](https://www.loopnet.ca/Listing/Houston-St-Cleveland-TX/25159463/) is the specific listing, I am scraping various data for. I run into an error with scraping for \"**Sale Type\"**\n\nWhat I did to tackle this: these are the steps of my code:\n\n1. find all elements that have the data-fact-type='SaleType' and store into a list\n2. iterate through this list\n3. each iteration i check one of the elements to see if it contains a span tag (since the data i want is exclusive to a span tag). if it is found, it saves the data to a variable and breaks out of the program\n4. if not, it will keep iterating through until it is finished with the list\n\nWhat's happening: When I run the code I get the following:  \n`# of elements with data-fact-type of SaleType:  2`  \n`Sale: Not found`  \n`Sale: Not found`\n\nHere is the code for that specific section: [https://codeshare.io/X8xNxl](https://codeshare.io/X8xNxl)\n\n`# Find all the sale elements with the given CSS selector`  \n `sale_types = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"[data-fact-type='SaleType']\")`  \n `print('\\n\\n# of elements with data-fact-type of SaleType: ' , len(sale_types))`  \n `for sale_type in sale_types:`  \n   \n `try:`  \n `span_element = sale_type.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, \"span\")`  \n `sale = span_element.text`  \n `print(\"Sale: \", sale)`  \n `except NoSuchElementException:`  \n `print(\"Sale: Not found\")`",

            "selftext": "I know this is a really general question and of course it depends on your goals and the tools that the programming language that you are using offers. But it is a problem that I have frequently encountered in my short time programming and I have not found a concrete way of dealing with it. I will try to give some examples to showcase what I mean.\n\nSuppose you have a class \"customer\". The usual case is that you will have some strings to store their name, their email address, telephone number etc, perhaps an integer for their age, some struct or boolean for their gender and so on and so forth. These are already a lot of fields to handle and, as a result, if you are writing functions that operate on those fields (like writing them to a file or reading them from a file for example), your code will be very repetitive and tedious to write. Now, in some cases, the situation is even worse. Suppose you also want to store different kinds of measurements for these customers, such as body metrics, blood metrics etc. Each of these metrics has some amount of trivial fields and, again, if you want to operate on those fields in some way, you have to write tedious and repetitive code.\n\nWhat I find particularly annoying about situations like the above, is that the types are extremely trivial. They are usually just a number of trivial types like strings, float or integers. However, to my limited knowledge, there seems to be no fool-proof way of just iterating through the fields, perhaps even in some recursive manner, and gaining access to them. There are structures like tuples or named tuples that seem to make it a little easier, but it seems to me that it should be a lot easier than it is right now.\n\nHave you come across problems like this? How do you cope with it?\n\nThanks.",

It helped me internalize it as a by-product of \"solving\" this.\n\nAlright, so I am learning programming more as a hobby than for getting a job because I am already in tech and enjoy my job. I am trying to up-level my skills, for my current position, so I can understand more about how our software works and look underneath the hood.\n\nI have chosen to go through The Odin Project and am taking it pretty slow to absorb the information.\n\nI am doing the Rock, Paper, Scissors exercise and have been working on it for 2 days or so with fits and starts. It's really forced me break down the code into small steps to make sure I actually understand what is happening within it. I got to section 5, building piece by piece but realized I had no idea what to do once it asked me to run it 5 times so I am re-factoring things a bit.\n\nAlso, this has been insanely eye opening. I have used other platforms in the past and realized all I was really learning was syntax and to \"follow instructions\" without ever really internalizing what was happening in the code so I am having a series of mini light bulb moments CONSTANTLY. It is pretty clear that I didn't even really understand how loops work to properly apply them or even things as basic as functions.\n\nThe question:\n\nI have created 2 functions, one for getRandomNumber() that contains a for loop that will generate 5 random numbers. I have a second function getComputerChoice() that is intended to get 5 different choices of Rock, Paper and Scissors that the computer made.\n\nSo, within the for loop of getComputerChoice, I call the getRandomNumber function which generates a random number 5 times. Then the if/else block is executed to identify which choice the computer made and I am storing it into an array called computerChoices (as a first step to make sure things are working before I move on).\n\nWhat I can't quite grasp is how the for loop knows to use the NEW random number that is generated on each iteration of its loop. Is it because the randomNumber function is being called, run and return value stored to randomNumber on each iteration?....I may have just answered my own question while typing this out. I have been reading a ton of the loops and still maybe not quite grasping so thought I'd see if someone had a simple explanation of how it knows to use that new random number.\n\nIn writing this out, would it be possible to simplify this and rework the getRandomNumber function by removing the for loop in getRandomNumber and then the for loop in getComputerChoice will handle executing it 5 different times? I had something a bit similar but it was just outputting the same choice 5 times.\n\nI am getting the desired output in computerChoices array of 5 different choices being made but I want to make sure I understand the entirety before moving on.\n\n    Potential rework to this and just call randomNumber = getRandomNumber inside \n    for block inside of getComputerChoice?\n    function getRandomNumber() {\n     let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 90) + 1;\n     return randomNumber\n    }\n\n    Current functions of getRandomNumber and getComputerChoices that produce an \n    array of 5 different choices being made.\n    function getRandomNumber() {\n    //Loop through getting a random number 5 times\n    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        //Define variable that stores a random number between 1-100\n        let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 90) + 1;\n        //return the random number that is generated between 1-100\n        return randomNumber\n      }\n    }\n\n    function getComputerChoice() {\n    \n    //initialize variable that stores the computer choice based on what random number was generated between 1-100\n    let computerChoice;\n    //Initialize array to store each choice the computer makes on 1 iteration of the loop\n    let computerChoices = [];\n\n    //Loop to run the computer choice 5 different times\n    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){\n        //random number variable calls the getRandomNumber function to generate a random number 5 different times\n        randomNumber = getRandomNumber()\n        //Logic to decide if number lower than 30 and save Rock to computerChoice\n        if (randomNumber <= 30) {\n            computerChoice = \"Rock\";\n            //push the choice that was made to computerChoices array\n            computerChoices.push(computerChoice)\n            //console.log(computerChoices)\n        } else if (randomNumber > 30 && randomNumber <= 60) {\n            //Logic to decide if number is greater than 30 but lower than 60 save to computerChoice\n            computerChoice = \"Paper\";\n            //push the choice that was made to computerChoices array\n            computerChoices.push(computerChoice)\n            //console.log(computerChoices)\n        } else {\n            computerChoice = \"Scissor\";\n            //push the choice that was made to computerChoices array\n            computerChoices.push(computerChoice)\n            //console.log(computerChoices)\n        }\n      }\n    //Return the array of 5 choices chosen by the computer choice above\n    return computerChoices;\n    }\n\n    let fiveComputerChoices = getComputerChoice();\n    console.log(fiveComputerChoices);\n    ['Rock', 'Rock', 'Scissor', 'Scissor', 'Scissor']",

Always when I had any problem, I was just using console.log() to log everything that could cause errors. Now I decided to start using debugger in VSC but my problem is that whenever I run this debugger, it ignores my breakpoints, goes through all the code and then closes. Whenever I watch tutorials on using debugger, after running it you have always acces to the bar with the debug options (e.g to skip a certain step) and in my case, it just flashes and then close. It might be some silly problem since as I said, didn't used debugger a lot, but I have no idea how to fix it.\n\n Also I don't know how to use debugger on incoming request, what if I want to step into a function which runs on incoming requests? Let's say I have a form and I want to see the request body via debugger. How can I cause debugger to run when the request is sent?\n\nI hope everything I wrote is quite understandable since english is not my native language, and I dont feel very confident with using it.

For example, so anyone can add an extra blog, or content as required to some aspects of the website without using third parties like wordpress or firebase.\n\nThe current plan the company is using is Shared Hosting to minimize expenses, and it does not have node js, only php. It has cPanel on it already. I looked online and saw people recommending to switch to VPS, but it's exponentially more expensive on average.\n\nWhat are your recommendations? try to build the back-end with PHP, or push for VPS and do it with Node? or if there is any other scenario that could be done?\n\nI tried to post over at /webdev, but my post got auto removed, so here I am :) \n\nThank you very much !!",

I'll apply for a master's degree in CS in 4-5 months so I'm currently learning programming from scratch. The interview question consists of two parts, including programming and DSA. After a month I finished CS50x and took algorithm I in Coursera. After looking at the first assignment, I'm so confused because I have zero knowledge of java. Should I take a course that uses python instead? Or should I learn java to finish this course? I saw many comments about how python is not good for learning DSA and that a beginner should learn one language at a time.  \n\nThanks!",

The project is more like a patient doctor program. In which the program will ask some particular questions from the patients and then after all the details the program will give recommendations to the patients after getting trained through datasets. I have prepared the object of this project and only selected a dataset and loaded it. Next what I know I have to do is cluster the data using kmeans as my teacher told me. So I'm asking a little help from you guys that how can I do clustering and what are the next steps? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "I apologize for asking a career-related question in this subreddit, and I understand that it is not its primary purpose. However, I would appreciate hearing your opinion on whether my decision to quit my current job and focus on my side job as a coder is the right one.\n\nfor some context about myself. I am a 25-year-old who dropped out of university due to financial constraints and the pandemic in Lebanon. I worked as a stone mason for about a year and a half but had to stop due to a wrist injury. Later, I completed an 8-month full-stack bootcamp focused on React, and performed well in it. However, my current job involves more business and planning work than coding (even though it was advertised as a JavaScript developer role), as it is focused on Zoho CRM, and I do not get to do much coding. Additionally, my workplace is a startup and there are no lifecycle environments. As a result, I feel that I am not gaining enough experience in coding.\n\nOn the other hand, I have been working on project-based side jobs and have been enjoying them while gaining valuable experience. My side project involves working with serverless Lambda functions with AWS, as well as working with Postgres SQL and now Angular. This work has offered me valuable experience working on real projects using a variety of technologies. Currently, I have only two weeks left in my probation period, and I earn $650 per month from this full-time job, which includes two days a week onsite (about an hour in the car), and $300 per month from my side job as a coder, which offers Udemy courses and opportunities to work on large projects for both front-end and back-end development. Given my financial situation and desire to improve my coding skills, should I quit my full-time job and focus on my side job as a coder, which offers me more opportunities to gain coding experience and earn a higher income in the future?  what you take in this question, what should i do",

            "selftext": "I'm looking for info on frameworks used for creating audio plugins used in Digital Audio Workstations (aka DAWs). To be clear, I'm asking because I use audio plugins, not because I code and want to start coding plugins. I have practically zero background in coding.  I'm seeing similarities in issues between plugins of different manufacturers which I use, which seem to use similar or identical frameworks, and I'm trying to make things clearer for myself. It's kind of like learning just a bit about how a car's engine works to know which car NOT to buy, not because you're interested in becoming a mechanic. So here's what I'm trying to figure out:\n\n1- Is it the juce framework that gives a \u201cwindows style\u201d header bar in the standalone app like the plugins from stl tones, audiority, klanghelm, etc. even when it's running on macOS?\n\n2- If the answer to #1 is yes, how can I check if a plugin uses juce if it doesn't come with a standalone app and only runs within a DAW?\n\n3- What framework would plugins like those of Neural DSP be using for example? As their standalone app on Mac looks like a normal Mac app, and they behave much more smoothly, are less jittery, and are more stable overall both in standalone mode and in DAWs (tried all plugin formats (AU, VST2, VST3, AAX) in several DAWs on Intel and Apple Silicon Native (taking into consideration when the latter is possible)).\n\n4- Are the new Universal Audio Native plugins and LUNA DAW using electron?? Is that even possible??\n\nThanks a lot in advance for the info!",

There is still coding that is required depending on how far you stray from pre-made templates (and I stray pretty far) but I'm not confident that it'll be very interesting to employers. \n\nWhere I think it helps, is that I'm still making web applications that make db calls to a relational database, using Microsoft Dataverse. I would guess that the experience of gathering requirements and building a web app are similar to actual dev work. I wouldn't know since I haven't worked as a dev yet.\n\nDo you think this would still be useful experience to have, or should I really ramp up what I'm learning on my own time (Self-taught web development)? I also have some schooling in C# and I'm interested in a quiet .NET enterprise job.

(long post ahead...)\n\nI've always been interested in learning programming but the prospect of it really intimidated me and I had a lot of trouble making sense of all the resources and where to start so I decided to enrol in a certificate program in university hoping for a bit of structure as for steps for how to learn and I've never been more confused in my life. \n\nPrior to going back to school, I had a tiny bit of \"programming\" knowledge messing around translation software databases (when I was completing my bachelor's in translation, it mostly involved macros but it really sparked that interest again) and I had learned basic syntax and structure in Python.\n\nNow I'm learning Java with a professor who isn't very encouraging and gets lost in his own codes. I feel like I'm getting a grasp at basic concepts and I have completed a few assignments (albeit with so much help from online resources, idk how people write their own codes from scratch, couldn't be me) and quite frankly I'm getting a little scared that I'm not learning enough, fast enough. \n\nEveryone says to just keep coding and practice but where am I supposed to practice enough to see some results? How do I take what I'm learning in theory and in short lines or codes and turn it into something that I could understand and write and eventually (with much more time) make a career out of? \n\nIf anyone has any tips or simple words of encouragement, I'd be very grateful.\n\nThank you",

After some hassle I got all my business entities with their relation directly tied to my database. Recently I added multi context support seem OK but not really tested yet. \n\nThe problem comes as I feared when my tables become filled with a great quantity of rows, the initial loading and the data retrievings slow down. \n\nSo I wonder many things now:\n\n1- can I hope having decent speed with sqlite? I know it's not the fastest but I choose it for simplicity reasons and easy dB file manipulations. \n\n2- my link operations are mainly \"where\"s. I have some\" contains\" that I should ideally get rid off. I don't use select at all. Some advice? \n\n3- I could paginate results that show lots of records but I don't like it for UX reasons. I thought I could avoid it working locally. Wpf UI uses some refresh tricks to avois load everything in memory, I think it is optimised with dbsets used by entity framework. \n\n4- sometimes I cast to lists but those cases aren't the heavy one, how bad should I use iterators? \n\n5- I've read to not directly interact with data from dbsets but kinda have a supplementary articulation, but it would be so sad, turning that elegant architecture I'm trying to be able to be proud of into spaghetti yet again... \n\nIf you have some experience in this kind of .net application, or even regarding any of those questions, I'd be glad to have your lights!",

We really only went through fundamentals in schools like loops, conditions, lists and stuff like that.\n\n2) Should I steer away from the hints provided on codingame?

What I want to do is build something that'll be accessible in browser, hosted on my home server in a Docker Container, that provides the ability add \"sources\" to a database, that'll then be routinely scrapped using the yt-dlp tool via it's API. Sort of like mix of \"TubeSync\" and \"Tube Archivist\" really.\n\nI'm not 100% sure where to start though. Like what I need to learn? I figure some python for the scripting? HTML for the front end? Docker for the hosting? SQL for the database? I don't know, it would be nice to have a sort of roadmap. Like \"like this, then that, then this, then you'll have half a clue how to do this bit\" sort of thing. I feel like there's a million things to learn, and not sure what I should learn first. Sort of want to start at the bottom layer of this tool, and learn that bit, build that build, move to the next layer, learn that, build that. You know?\n\nI'm aware there are plenty of tools out there already that do this to one degree or another. But see none of them do exactly 100% what I want. And I have no illusions I could do better. Hell the setup I'm looking to build could ultimately be worse lol. But I'm really interested in trying. So figure, what better way to learn something, than pursue a project you're passionate about.\n\nAfter a little learning and tinkering I might even end up going \"F it\", and then just lending my time (wherever I can assist) to one of the existing projects out there. Who knows. But figure, should to do the groundwork first, lest I'd just be a nuisance to them, proposing ideas, and not helping at all with them. \n\nFor background, I've been working as a Analyst the last 7 years. Originally it was analysing data and building reports in Excel. This later involved working with VBA to automate various \"dashboard\" update/management tasks. Nowadays it's all Power Platform (Power BI/Power Apps). I'd say I'm highly proficient in both these applications, being both a lead developer in my organisation with these tools (about 3000 people), and also a primary support person for junior developers. And was a gun at Excel and VBA when that was the cool kid.\n\nI'm confident whatever I need to pickup, I can do it, but yeah, just need a hand identifying what my learning roadmap would be on my journey to build this thing.",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRecently I got the idea to start a hobby project in which I plan to make an application which can visualize my IBS symptons and flare-ups to make it more clear what is triggering them.\n\nI've decided to make a simple mobile app for data gathering. I want to make this app as non-intrusive as possible so I don't get demotivated with supplying data and I can get good long-term data. (I've tried other IBS tracking apps but they usually required a lot of user interaction for providing data).\n\nI plan to make this app for Android Only and use Android Studio for this. Now I come from an Embedded C background so this is a full 180 for me, for this reason I would like to minimize the functionality of this app to just the data gathering and posting.\n\nTo visualize this data, I would like to build some kind of desktop/web application which takes the data from the Android app and presents it to the user in a insightful way. However for this visualization app, I'm not quite settled on what techstack I would want to use to realise it. Initially I thought I would just use Python with some UI framework but I really don't want to limit my options. So that's why I came here! What tech/language would you suggest for this use case?\n\nMy experiences are as following:\n\n* C: Good/Expert\n* Python: Fair\n* Java: Minimal\n* C++: Minimal\n* Linux: Fair\n* Webdev: Basically none\n\nThanks in advance!",

My coding and mathematical skills are both quite weak, however this course it aimed at people without a background in IT.\n\nIn the first week we were given tasks to write algorithms showing node expansion for Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Iterative Deepening. We covered the concepts in class at a theoretical level which I feel I understand, but we didn't touch on coding at all.\n\nI was expecting we might get some guidance/breakdown on the approaches to code them instead of being asked to do it completely ourselves - I am giving it a go but I feel very lost quite early on. Is this something that should just come intuitively? The fact that the course has just started and I'm struggling hasn't made me feel exactly great.\n\nAnother facet I'm struggling with is when I looking to get just \"little\" tips from coding tutorial sites/stack overflow on these concepts, I'm receiving the entire functions, so I feel like I'm not learning at all.\n\nAny advice on if this is a reasonable assessment new students should be able to do solo, and how to actually learn to code when researching online - it's giving me a lot of imposter syndrome when I just get the entire answers online.  (I'm looking for a fine line between getting a bit of help to help progress my learning journey without being fed the answers).\n\nThank you for your time!",

Do you use books? Documentation? Start a project in the language? What strategies do you use to learn a NEW language?",

I use VS Code, and it often auto-fills certain things for me (like it already has closing parentheses/brackets/quotes/etc., but I don't know how to move the cursor without using my directional keys. For example, if I type this in .... \n\nconsole.log(friends\\[2\\])\n\nAfter I type in the number 2, my cursor is next to the number that I just typed, and VS code has already written the closing bracket and closing parentheses for me. What I find myself doing is hitting my right keyboard button to move over twice, that way I can finish my line with a semi-colon. But I can't imagine this is the best way of doing it since I have to lift my hand so much. \n\nIs there a very easy way to jump from the number 2 and skip the closing bracket and closing parentheses that VS code has already inputted? Or am I expected to just type in the closing bracket and parentheses, even though it's already there (VS code doesn't made it double when I type in what's already there). \n\nI hope this made sense...

            "selftext": "So, I think I'm starting down the path to a career change - I'm an ESL teacher at the moment, used to be a product manager for digital educational platforms before the pandemic hit and it mainly consisted of doing UX research and working with developers in building the products. I've spoken to a few people working in software and web dev in a few different industries, and they've said boot camps aren't a bad idea but that I should do some free/cheap courses online first.\n\nI've started doing the 100 days of code python course on udemy, and I've been really enjoying it so far. Think I'm about 5 hours into the course, but I've probably spent longer messing about in replit trying to make silly things with the python I've learned already.\n\n**Some questions:** \n\n1. Are full-stack dev courses such as the one provided by 'Makers Academy' well regarded by employers? Will undertaking a 'boot camp' type course will restrict me to certain areas (i.e. web design for mum and dad style businesses) with regards to the sort of work I'd like to do in the future?\nI'm also a bit put off by the quantity and quality of marketing material (typos, a quiz form not working etc) with some of these providers, and I really want to avoid snake oil salesmen!\n\n2. Should I be thinking about the sort of area I want to be working in right now, and trying to specialize in processes, languages etc specific to that area, or is it best to go into this with a blank palette and go from there? \n\n3. Can I leverage anything at all from my previous career? I understand that building up my knowledge, skills and portfolio are my priorities right now, but when it comes to job hunting, will my ~6 years in product management count for anything at all? I used to work with XML/HTML and CSS, but wouldn't call myself an expert, worked in an agile environment (i.e. paid lip service to agile principles) and obviously can run UX research projects to a professional standard and use frameworking software etc. I also have a bullshit degree in Philosophy, and then 3 or so years working as an ESL teacher abroad...\n\nTLDR: I suppose I'm just a bit worried that at 32, coming up 33, I've left it all too late. Am I doing the right thing by looking into a Boot Camp and doing the free courses in the mean time? Should I be doing anything else?",

Tips that maybe helped them? Is it normal to stare at the screen and have no idea where to begin even with directions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working through The Odin Project with some difficulty as a complete newbie with no coding experience. Started in Jan. Was having trouble understanding concepts in CSS Flexbox and finishing the assignments w/o struggling. It wasn't was **super difficult** but as a newbie w/ ADHD, when it came time to sit down and work out how to solve problems on an empty screen... I'd be drawing blanks on where to even begin and it was frustrating 85% of the time.\n\nMy \"smart\" solution? After lots of research, itd be best for me to stop TOP temporarily and work through CS50. With the plan to pick back up w/ TOP after CS50 week 8/9 where it comes back to Html,CSS, and Javascript. I figured regardless of how slow I might be at learning, if I could make it through CS50 atleast to that point, i'd have a WAY easier time w/ understanding the material and working through it. I also feel like I'd get more out of TOP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut... the experience is so demoralizing. I'm pretty tech savvy but this just feels so different from TOP. I've learned alot even though I feel like i'm failing badly and have learned nothing. \n\n I'll find myself sitting in front of my computer for hours w/ no idea where to start. Take a break and come back and its the same. I barely know how to ask the right questions to get me to where I want most of the time. I've been stuck on Week 2 since middle of February. The only reason I was able to solve 90% of the problems was because I had massive help from either the discord or if I peek into a youtube video to atleast see how THEY started which is against the rules and doesn't sit right with me because then I feel like i'm not learning shit. I tend to be big on shortcuts and i'm really trying my best to take this seriously and give it my all because coding is my last solution to stability but fuck...  \n\nLike there'll be days I don't even open VSCODE because I know I'll just sit there feeling fucking confused and lost. I don't want to give up and I don't plan on it but Idk what to do to not feel demoralized al lthe time.. I know if I keep feeling this way, my quality of time spent actually learning decreases and eventually I'll just stop trying.",

After finishing it and refactoring it more to terms of OOP(thats an overstatement), it struck me that I can simply use simple \u201cinterface\u201d where keys could be specified, and so amount of this keys will be passed to number of graphs and so on. So now I think my code could basically apply to almost every API of that type.\nAnd now I have desire to work on it long term of expanding it further  to a website, where user could load urls of API which interest him in his profile, choose desired values from a list on which he can then track over time through graphs or simply looking at history? I know this sounds lame, but it seems like good opportunity to learn Flask/databases/bootstrap/etc through this project and also maybe include it to portfolio? I have no desire to do generic to-do lists, but I am scared that my project will be too useless and why would even in theory people use something so redunant, when you could yourself code this simple parser in seconds and have full control of it.

I tried game development for getting a portfolio of projects up but kept getting bored/stuck and putting it aside, and I then went through some of the CS50 AI online course, until recently where I began going through The Odin Project. \n\nMy background is a maths degree where most of the module choices/projects I chose were related to programming. I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to Python, but that's about it. Game dev was C# but I wouldn't say I know that language.\n\nI literally just want to get out of this horrible job ASAP, but on the rare occasion I look up programming related stuff on youtube that isn't a literal \"how do I solve this coding problem\" question, I always see the annoying clickbait titles and thumbnails saying things like \"Web dev is DEAD in 2023\", \"Why you will NEVER be hired as a junior developer\", \"This ONE thing is keeping you from getting a job\". I was literally just trying to check reviews of The Odin Project before I started it but seeing those thumbnails and titles just makes me feel a bit worse.\n\nI assume they are wrong though? Or vastly exaggerated. I am not aiming for a faang company and I know if I wanted that, I would have needed to be building a portfolio and doing internships during my time at university. It's probably possible even now but would be quite a long shot. I just want to find a job, presumably in web dev seeing as I am doing The Odin Project which is for web development if anyone hasn't heard of it, and for now I don't mind starting out in some small name local company paying \u00a325k a year or whatever.\n\nI also am not that bothered whether or not it's web dev, but TOP appears to actually be teaching me skills I will need to use as a developer such as the linux terminal, git and good git practices/conventions, and I can build a portfolio of web dev stuff throughout the course. And that's what I feel I'm getting out of TOP compared to doing loads of beginner game dev/Unity courses or even the CS50 AI course.\n\nSorry if this post is a bit of a rant. I believe I've managed to ask some questions and vent some (hopefully) understandable frustrations about trying to get a job in software development.

And can click deeper into those specific parts to find out what they are or what their part numbers are and see images of what they look like. Maybe even by clicking on a labeled image itself rather than just hyperlinks next to it. \n\nI've looked into MySQL as a database program and it seems promising for storing that base information like part numbers and names and how much are needed in a sub-assembly, but im not sure if itd be good for this kind of UI based thing of clicking on images and sorting/search bar and stuff?

I have a job and I've been working on this before/after work hours basically every day for around two hours. I'm already 70% through the JS course & learning React at the moment. I could say with confidence that I'm enjoying coding and can picture myself doing this for a living, of course the money being good as well plays a big factor.\n\nPlan was to finish the course and start applying for jobs while working in the meantime, so I wouldn't have any unemployment gaps. However recently an opportunity came up for me to work at a university (not in the same field as programming), chances are quite high that I will get the job since I have previous experience teaching and I know some of the professors there so I have good references. I already know the money won't be nearly as good as having a career in web-dev, but there are a lot more benefits taking this career path (at the Uni) and I know I'll regret it quite a bit if I don't take this opportunity.\n\nBut I already feel pretty bad for spending almost a year teaching myself programming and knowing I most probably won't work as a dev. Not saying that I can't use my learned skills in fields other than software development, but I won't be earning nearly as much.\n\nI've already read posts that it's very hard to take up freelancing, especially without a year or two of work experience as a developer, so I doubt I will succeed in being a freelancer anytime soon, if at all.\n\nI was wondering if any of you guys have come across work in the form of needing a helping hand with some projects with the opportunity to earn a bit on the side that way? I'm not asking for work at the moment just to be clear, I guess I just want to reassure myself that all these hours spent learning (and those hours still to come) would actually bring me some extra income.",

I often find myself torn between different career paths, unsure of which one to pursue. I am hoping to seek guidance and advice from those who have experienced similar struggles or have insights to share.\n\nOn one hand, I am considering learning web development, specifically focusing on html/css/js and if you look on my post history i am doing it currently alongside with job. I am aware that this field is oversaturated at the entry level, but the potential for a high income without a degree is appealing. However, I am also intimidated by the numerous frameworks and libraries which i will have to learn, which can be overwhelming for a beginner. projects made by me are total garbage. Also to be honest i have not any interest in this field and currently learning it only for money.\n\nOn another hand, I am also drawn to the growing field of data science. I find math to be intriguing, and this field seems to be expanding rapidly. Pursuing a degree in this field seems like a viable option, but I am afraid about potentially failing at this path and wasting my 20s.\n\nFurthermore, in regards of my current situation I have graduated law, but the legal industry in my country pays poorly so i am concerned about missing opportunities in lucrative field of tech and i constantly tell myself that if you work harder for 2/3 years maybe you will land well paying job. but since middle school i was not friend with numbers and performed terribly in STEM subjects so at least it seems safer path but less rewarding.\n\nAt the same time, I desire financial stability and the ability to provide for my family. my dream is too safe up money up to one million. I feel like i am in my turning point right now, feel anxious everyday , concerned that I may make a devastating mistake in choosing the wrong path. I blame myself to be unprincipled, inconsistent stupid, individual.\n\nHow to choose one right path to follow principally ?\n\nThank you in advance for your guidance and support.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nBefore asking my question let me introduce myself so you know a bit about the background I'm asking from. I studied Physics and I'm currently working as a Science high school teacher. During my years at college, I did all my programming in Python, so I know a bit about Python for data visualisation, data fitting, numerical simulations and random processes. I'm also interested in Science and Maths popularisation and recently I got interested in generative art. That's why I started learning Processing.\n\nI want to do Science and Maths visual simulations (random walks and diffusion, fractals, double slit simulations and that sort of stuff). I don't want to simply do a visual representation (I've found Processing to be a very useful tool for that), but I want to analyse data from those representations and plot it.\n\nFor example, my first processing code has been a random walk. I want to plot the average distance the random walker travels and the probability of visiting a cell n times after N steps.\n\nI'd like to have the utilities languages like Processing provides for doing visual stuff and the utilities of Python for the more \"numeric\" things.\n\nIs there any way to integrate both languages in the same project? For example, a processing code that simulates and represents the random walk, a Python code for the data and a way to represent both in the same window?\n\nOr is there any other programming language that works fine for both things? Should I stick to Python alone to also do visual representations (I know it is possible, but Processing is easier to work with for animations) or should I learn to do the numeric stuff in Processing?\n\nThanks for reading!",

But I'm really scared for the day I'm expected to be able to fix these hot bugs, especially those totally blocking the customer from their activities. I'd like to volunteer, but I'm afraid it's time wasted of me trying to fix it but got nowhere, time that could've been used by the others to fix it. The others are also somehow able to fix every hot bug without asking help from another, so it's kind of taken that someone who pick it up is going to solve it fully and quickly.\n\nI'm also afraid of the customers too, some can be pushy and intimidating, expecting fast fixes.

            "selftext": "Hello World!\n\nI'm writing this post so some people can hopefully guide me in the right direction so I can ensure I do good on my first ever technical interview. After countless companies rejecting me(as I'm sure 99% of you can relate), this is the one I cannot fail. So, the internship I have been going through is f5's 'cybersecurity operations and product management apprenticeship' . Based on the job description maybe one can gauge what interview questions should look like.\n\nTo add some more context, I asked my recruiter what to expect and she said 'I still have not heard of what they will be testing you on but I know it will be pretty basic. Just to see what you do know about Python and your problem solving skills and how receptive you are to advice and feedback.' I also asked the manager what to expect and he said, 'We are still deciding what coding challenges we plan to use, so I don't have a firm answer\u00a0yet. But I expect that there will be 2-3 challenges, with the first one easy (a \"warmup\") and subsequent ones will be more difficult. Nothing too crazy though, the questions should be appropriate for a CSC student with 1-3 years of classes.' I also asked him a couple days before this over zoom and he said data structures , min/max/avg, stuff like that.\n\nI have been doing my best in leetCode questions and trying to learn as much as I can. But it is just so hard to know if I am spending the right time on the right thing. Does anyone here have any sort of insight? What should I practice? Which problems? I have been learning the window sliding technique and two pointers/fast slow pointers stuff right now. Should I expect only easy LeetCode problems are medium ones too?\n\nAny help is really, really, really appreciated. Thank you",

We hadn't covered much at this point, mostly just integer variables and pointers.\n\nHere's the guidelines and what should happen:\n\n* Karel starts at left corner\n* The next two squares represent two numbers\n* First square is tens digit, second is ones digit\n* Karel takes these two numbers and combines them into one\n* He places this number of items into the next square\n* He should end at the eastern corner, orientation doesn't matter\n* Map shape is exactly 1 by 5\n* Do not edit the function headers, just fill in information between TODO statements\n\nRight now Karel picks up the items on the squares, but doesn't drop any. I added printf statements to debug, and they both print as 0, which is why I think the issue is with my pointers. I don't think I understand the syntax enough to figure out what's wrong or where to go from here though. Below is my current code.

Do you have any tips or tricks to help not get bummed, Im wondering if I could get a programmer buddy to talk with here and there?",

I need to use hash tables, and the key-value pair needs to look like this: [word, [array of synonyms related to it]]. It also needed to have the translative rule, so if I input words \"wash\"(the \"main\" word), \"clean\" and \"rinse\", I basically need to make 3 words which have the other 2 words as the synonyms. I got over that by making a function outside the hash table which accepts all of the inputted words and synonyms in a single array, and it makes all of the possible \"outcomes\".\nIf I pass ['clean', 'wash', 'rinse'] to it, it will pass:('clean', ['wash', 'rinse']), ('wash', ['clean', 'rinse']) & ('rinse', ['clean', 'wash']) in the set function. I couldn't come up with a better solution. Now, the problem was if I wanted to update the word, and so if I input wash again and add scrub, I needed to just concat to the array of synonyms for wash and also add scrub to all of the other words that are synonyms to wash. That's were the problem is. I need to use a for loop in the set function that checks if the key exist, and if it does, just concats new synonyms to the array. Is it bad to use for loops in hash tables, because of the time complexity? If someone has a better solution to my assignment, I would be really thankful. Also, keep in mind that this is my first time using hash tables in js.\n\n\nThanks in advance.",

I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. \n\nMy initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. \n\nTo get to my point: \n\nI am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. \n\nShould I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. \n\nNeither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. \n\nBeing in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? \n\nSince I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?\n\nThanks!",

That part I can do and have already done. What I'm struggling with is that I want to include the city the customer lives in today in that row that displays the sum of the customer's revenue. So basically, the city associated with the customer in 2023 should be the one chosen (or 2022 if there's no 2023, or 2021 if there's no 2022, etc.)\n\nOne way I thought of was to create a new field, 6. current_city, and include it in the group by clause. Seems like it would work, but how do I go about creating a field like that in the first place? I can't picture how to calculate a field in a row based on values in other rows.\n\nFields 1, 2, 4, and 5 I already have and come directly from the database. Field 3 is a calculated field, a concatenate on 1 and 2.\n\nI can't think of how to even describe this problem, so I didn't have any luck with google or elsewhere.",

            "selftext": "This is probably very basic, but we have two questions about struct and union in C language, and they don't give out solutions, so I would like to know if my understanding is correct\n\n**Question 1**. Let there be a machine with the 32-bit architecture. Let there be two similar definitions of structures:\n\n    struct Fields { \n        char a; \n        char b; \n        int number; \n    };  \n    struct Hills { \n        char a; \n        int number; \n        char b; \n    };\n\nIs there any difference between these definitions in terms of memory consumption? How much space (in bytes) will a C compiler allocate for them if\n\n* the char type occupies 1 bytes\n* the int type occupies 4 bytes\n\nExplain your reasoning.\n\nMy reasoning: Yes, there is a difference due to padding. In a 32-bit processor, the processor reads 4 bytes at a time.  That means that the first Struct \"Fields\" would need two CPU cycles, because the first two char occupy 2 bytes inside the 4 bytes. The int occupies needs 4 bytes so it would need a new cycle for itself, so two CPU cycles in total. The second struct \"Hills\" would need three CPU cycles, because the first char takes 1 byte inside the 4 bytes, but then the int needs 4 bytes for itself, so a second CPU cycle is needed for the int only, and then the last char takes 1 byte inside another new cycle. Note that this would be different on a 64-bit processor where 8 bytes can be read at a time, so only one CPU cycle would be needed in both cases (1 + 1 + 4 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 < 8 bytes)\n\n**Question 2**. Let there be a machine with the 32-bit architecture. Let there be two similar definitions of unions:\n\n    union Fields { \n        char a; \n        char b; \n        int number; \n    };  \n    union Hills { \n        char a; \n        int number; \n        char b; \n    };\n\nIs there any difference between these definitions in terms of memory consumption? How much space (in bytes) will a C compiler allocate for them if\n\n* the char type occupies 1 bytes\n* the int type occupies 4 bytes\n\nExplain your reasoning.\n\nMy reasoning: No, for Unions there is no difference because the size of an Union in C language is always the size of the largest element inside it. Both Unions contain an int, which occupies 4 bytes while char only occupies 1 byte, so the size of both unions will be 4 bytes\n\nCould you please check my understanding ? It's probably very basic, but we have no solutions, so I can't know for sure. Thank you so much for your help",

I thought it just changes what is being pointed to - not that it actually does any node removal? \n\nalso, since \\*lpp points to the next pointer of the node, does `(*lpp) -> next` point to the next pointer of the succeeding node (basically the next of the 'next' pointer)?\n\nthank you and sorry for my bad English!",

Hold on, give such a simple command literally 5 mins to process.\n\nI'm confused. I thought a tool like that should help us become more capable, efficient and faster. What happens instead is that it slows my whole workflow. I might as well just stick to using the terminal despite its limitations in the UI.\n\nAnyone can share feedback?

I have a feeling that this is not good practice (?) and that it may be considered better (?) to write and call methods which pass data between each other as arguments?\n\n\\- Less basic, less verbose fundamental code writing. I guess that my code is pretty basic, conditionals may be able to be improved, more succinct syntax maybe.\n\n\\- And anything else someone who properly understands how to write this stuff can advise on.\n\nHere's the link the repository on Githib; [https://github.com/jbk2/the-odin-project/tree/main/ruby\\_exercises/hangman](https://github.com/jbk2/the-odin-project/tree/main/ruby_exercises/hangman)\n\nAlas, let the laughter commence \ud83e\udd74!\n\nThanks in advance.",

Of course, player can teleport from one empty area to another if possible. And player can also buy block and create more empty area.\n\nSee the below for the example:\n\nSo, imagine the playground was look like this:\n\n    0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0\n\nWhere 1 is the block and 0 is the empty space. As you can see, it have 3 empty areas which is the area contains 0 and separated by 1.\n\n    1.\n          0\n    2.\n          0 0 0\n    3.\n          0 0 0\n          0 0 0 0 0\n          0 0 0 0 0\n\nThen the game will spawn coins in each of the empty area (In this case will spawn 3 coins if not upgraded)\n\nAt first, I try storing all the points into an table (2d array), but the problem occurred when the playground was too big and eating up lot of memory, also the cause the game lag when placing block.\n\nThen I try to use some graph search algorithm (binary tree search doesn\u2019t seem to work because a block may connect more than 1 block.)\n\nI\u2019m also try using boundary check algorithm like [Moore neighborhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) algorithm but it just ended up not working (I think it my fault maybe...)\n\nSo, all I have was an array contain all coordinated of the block, the width and height of the playground are the same. Is there\u2019s any algorithm that helped me solve the problem? If not, any tip? I actually spent my last week on solutions.\n\nThank you for your time!",

However, if I look at the scroll button on the right of the terminal, it looks like it's just adding more blank space.\n\nI wanted to know what I'm doing wrong. Is it the code? I checked for errors and found none that I noticed (still learning, so I am bound to miss something simple still). Or is it because it's not meant to run on VS Code terminal and instead on another program(?) I feel it is the second reason but I'm not too sure. Can anyone help out?

I mean, I can understand why you would want to create the value at a new location if the primitives are mutable, but they are immutable, so if 'y' instead pointed to '0x1' instead of creating a copy, then 'y' would be safe because updating 'x' would just create a new value at a different location and point to it.\n\nObviously there's a lot that I'm not understanding here, but can someone help me and explain why you would not want the primitives to be mutable ever?",

There is a millisecond-precise timestamp within the object, if I'm willing to assume that two events will not happen at the same millisecond, I can ensure that every event I parse happens after the latest timestamp I have ever parsed. My problem here is that if I crash I don't know where I am in the series and so do not know where to pick back up even looking.\n\n2. Store every event I parse in a simple database (SQLite maybe?) using a hash of the object as a primary key, and when starting always begin from a timestamp well before the latest one in my DB and always upsert.\n\nI'm curious to know how others would approach this problem and if either of these ideas seems reasonable (I am currently favoring solution 2)",

If you don\u2019t know how to do x you gotta search for something giving some informations to you. I think it is more a question of mindset and expectations. Self-learning could mean that, if you have doubts, you can start to search for that information that you need until you don\u2019t find it. Docs, books, forums, videos. And don\u2019t expect that it is spoon fed to you. \nI write this trying to exorcise the fear that sometimes I have when I do this. Sometimes I don\u2019t even think about it and I google around like hell. But some days I have doubts and fears like \u201cWhat am I doing? Is this really what happens out there?\u201d \nI explain you what I mean. I\u2019m making a project. I have to decompose it in smaller problems. I got very different ideas and here the \u201csearching phase\u201d begins. Maybe I\u2019m like \u201cmmm wait I can do x with this array to achieve y. Let me see if there is a way to do it!\u201d And I found myself learning so many different behaviors that you can do with strings, arrays, numbers and so on. For example, I wanted to find a way to change color randomly when you hover over and element. I had to find this solution searching around the web, then I studied all the elements of that function to be sure that I understood it\u2019s behavior and now I found myself self to know more methods and functions. \n\nBut my question is: how common is it to do this thing in your daily job? Like when you know what you wanna do but maybe you don\u2019t remember something or you need to search for the toosl to do what you have in mind. I read around people saying to get used to this, that it is daily practice to google for solutions, reading around blogs and articles. But sometimes, like I told you, I freeze. \n\nCan you tell me your experience in your daily jobs? What do you do when you don\u2019t know something? I go for docs, stackoverflow, and books mainly. \n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I know I come off as someone in a very dark place due to the content of this post. This is completely true story. I am already seeking help and I am trying to turn my life around.\n\n**Background:** I am a semi-recent grad, 27 yrs old. I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering Tech from the University of Akron (Northeast Ohio) in 2019. I was barely a 3.0GPA student, and struggled from day one as a college student. I have never been someone who would take things apart to see how they worked, or liked to experiment, or liked to do anything other than play video games. I never knew what to go to school for, but for some reason I started in mechanical engineering tech, and absolutely hated it. After two semesters I switched to EET based on the recommendation of my advisor. I started with absolutely no knowledge of anything Electrical or Electronics related, and struggled to learn the concepts, of which I still don\u2019t understand any of it. I failed almost every test ever handed out, and I only attribute my passing grades to Chegg and Lab work. The only subject understood was the coding classes (C and C++) that were part of my curriculum. However, for some reason I never pursued a job in this area of the field.\n\nDue to my massive amount of social anxiety and asocial tendencies, I never made any friends and was completely petrified of asking for help from professors. In my senior year of college, I really wanted to join the Formula SAE team (student run racing team that designed and built a race car), but ultimately chickened out. I left college feeling like I never earned my degree, and with a massive amount of depression. \n\nDue to my social anxiety, I squandered every opportunity I had to get a job lined up. Instead, I had to turn my attention to places like Indeed to be able to find a job. However, due to my lack of any experience I struggled to even get callbacks and was always turned down for someone with more experience. After a few months I found a position at a small company that built automation systems. The original agreement with that company was for me to start on the shop floor, learning how these systems were built, so that I could design systems that would be easy for the workers to build. I spent 8 months on the shop floor, 2 months longer than the original agreement, and was laid off at the start of the pandemic. \n\nAfter job hunting for a few months, I landed another position building automation systems at a much larger company. I only took the position because I had hopes of using that position as a springboard to get into an engineer position. I spend a few months waiting for the next round of interviews at the company to arrive. Unbeknownst to me, this was a round robin style interview process, where they pit you against other applicants and have group interviews, aka a total nightmare scenario for me. Again, I was turned down for the position due to a lack of experience in engineering, even though my application came with high recommendations from people inside the company. \n\nAfter I was turned down, I decided to start looking for a new position at another company. I found a test engineering role (although it ended up being more of a technician role) at a company that builds radiation detectors. After a year in this role (where I am currently), I am closer than I have ever been to an Engineering role, and I absolutely hate it. I hate everything about it. Every day I feel more and more out of my element, and its only made my depression worse.\n\nA few months ago, I had a mental breakdown. I have never been someone capable of opening up to people and sharing my thoughts. My mother made me promise to seek help. Since then I have been speaking a therapist, who is pushing me to turn my life in a different direction. I am in the dating pool for the first time in my life, and I am opening up more and talking about my struggles. However, there is still one thing holding me back, I hate my career choice. \n\nWith no other ideas of where I could go or what I could do, I decided to try and see if I still liked and still understood coding. I only had a small amount of experience with it, limited to the 3 classes I had in college. I found a YouTube video that would teach me the basics of Python, and while I was following along with the video, I started to remember everything I learned about coding and actually kind of enjoyed it. At this point, It is clear to me that coding was the only thing that I ever actually learned in college, and the only thing in EET that ever made any sense to me. \n\nHowever, I am unsure of this is the right direction to go with my life. I still have very little experience with coding, and only have a basic understanding of a few different languages. I still have very little interest in doing anything other than playing video games in my free time. I feel like everyone else in STEM is someone who likes to build things or experiment or something like that, and I am just not. \n\nI have no idea how to transition to a coding field, if this is even something that is right for me. Do I go back to college? Do I go to a coding boot camp? Do I teach myself? From my research, it seems like my EET degree is enough of a qualification to get some coding jobs, but I don't feel like I actually have enough experience to make it in that field. I am just totally lost and unhappy with where my life is at the moment. I am not sure how much longer I can continue like it is.",

And each card can have children that are other cards. \nEach card can be a different type depending on what ability or skill it is. \nWe have a whole module for the cards. \nThe \u201cCard\u201d class is the base class for all cards and each card also inherits an interface depending on what kind of card it is. \nI also have a \u201cCardServices\u201d class that has multiple methods. One being a Retrieve all cards method that returns a list of cards. \nI\u2019m trying to test that method but am confused on what/if there are any dependencies. Because the CardModule itself depends on nothing else other than the cards and the CardServices class which are all in the card module.  \nIt doesn\u2019t depend on the networking or simulation module to operate. \n\nSo what am I missing that can help me understand moq?

Where you can move your hands or arms in a certain motion and the game will respond. I've seen some python tutorials using cvzone or something like that. I Haven't looked too much into because idk if that's considered a visual programming language. So now the questions.\n\n**What is a vp language?** We're going to be using Max which to my knowledge is something to do with audio and synths. From what i've seen, a vpl is just something like scratch. Where there are blocks and stuff that you connect together to do something. If this is the case, then I have a follow up question.\n\n**What visual programming lang. can i use to make a game with hand tracking or really just to make a game?**\n\nBtw, idk if this is important, but i haven't used something like scratch in 6 years.

Id like to make a full stack app using node. I don't want to simulate the server, I want an actual server online. I don't want to spend a fortune to do this. I basically want to make a checkers game that is playable over the net. What sort of things would be good for this? I heard of something called nodemonitor so I was going to start there, but I need somewhere to host this server. Thank you!",

I'm a bit confused here as when I tried replacing my && into ||, the while loop doesn't break even if it already satisfied one condition (gemCounter == 3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something here? Shouldn't the while loop keep running unless both of my conditions are satisfied since I used the && operator and not the || operator?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my understanding, placing an || (or operator) indicates that the while loop will immediately stop once either one of the conditions become true. The && (and operator) on the other hand, requires both conditions to be marked as true in order for the while loop to stop. Am I wrong here? Because I can't seem to understand why my code immediately breaks despite the while loop not fulfilling both conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

Runescape private servers are usually written in Java (to my knowledge), so I do understand that creating something like a private server from scratch with no pre-existing templates in C takes time, dedication and effort. It is not lost on me that this will take a long time, and I might not even be able to finish it. \n\nI am very enthusiastic about this. Making my custom content, scripting quests, all in the sake of a new hobby I want to gain.\n\nWhere do I even begin? Any tips would be appreciated :)",

But it doesn't display my success message.\n\nHere is the code in my index:\n\n    <style>\n         .hide { position:absolute; top:-1px; left:-1px; width:1px; height:1px; }\n    </style>\n    \n    <iframe name=\"hiddenFrame\" class=\"hide\"></iframe>\n            \n    <form action=\"MyCustomSubURL\" method=\"post\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" target=\"hiddenFrame\">\n       <input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\" required placeholder=\"Email Address\" />\n       <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button\" /> \n    </form>  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a separate js file that holds my success message.\n\n    // Signup Form.\n            (function() {\n    \n                // Vars.\n                    var $form = document.querySelectorAll('#signup-form')[0],\n                        $submit = document.querySelectorAll('#signup-form input[type=\"submit\"]')[0],\n                        $message;\n    \n                // Bail if addEventListener isn't supported.\n                    if (!('addEventListener' in $form))\n                        return;\n    \n                // Message.\n                    $message = document.createElement('span');\n                        $message.classList.add('message');\n                        $form.appendChild($message);\n    \n                    $message._show = function(type, text) {\n    \n                        $message.innerHTML = text;\n                        $message.classList.add(type);\n                        $message.classList.add('visible');\n    \n                        window.setTimeout(function() {\n                            $message._hide();\n                        }, 3000);\n    \n                    };\n    \n                    $message._hide = function() {\n                        $message.classList.remove('visible');\n                    };\n    \n                // Events.\n                // Note: If you're *not* using AJAX, get rid of this event listener.\n                    $form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n    \n                        event.stopPropagation();\n                        event.preventDefault();\n    \n                        // Hide message.\n                            $message._hide();\n    \n                        // Disable submit.\n                            $submit.disabled = true;\n    \n                        // Process form.\n                        // Note: Doesn't actually do anything yet (other than report back with a \"thank you\"),\n                        // but there's enough here to piece together a working AJAX submission call that does.\n                            window.setTimeout(function() {\n    \n                                // Reset form.\n                                    $form.reset();\n    \n                                // Enable submit.\n                                    $submit.disabled = false;\n    \n                                // Show message.\n                                    $message._show('success', 'Thank you!');\n                                    //$message._show('failure', 'Something went wrong. Please try again.');\n    \n                            }, 750);\n    \n                    });\n    \n            })();\n    \n    })();\n\nWhen I change the $form and $submit to match the id of \"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" instead of \"signup-form\", the success message displays but the form is not posted.\n\n**How do I fix this? I want to stay on the same page and submit, which I have already achieved. But I want to also display that js success message as well.** Any help is greatly appreciated. Also, apologies reddit does not like to format code well.",

My idea is: some app that will show over the messenger game, read positions from reading screen, transform into board map then evaluate and graphically suggest best move for me.  \n\n\nProblem is: I feel overwhelmed. Because I need to have minimax separated, I spent hours thinking about how to print board into console. What's better? Board class or some non OOP data structure? What about refactor? Is this efficient enough? Isn't it ugly when program is only bunch of functions instead of rich OOP structure?  \nThen I struggle with how to represent board. List or string?  \nI am afraid to \"write is somehow\" because I easily lose concentration and chance this become a huge mess is just too big.  \n\n\nLet me tell you, I don't want answers for these questions.

It says command1/2 is called, which means its going into the if/else if statements, but then it somehow loops again and then says its unrecognised? Why is this happening?\n\nI feel like its something to do with MAX\\_BUFF being 15, but \"command1 abcde\" and \"command2     \" are both 14 char long.",

            "selftext": " \n\nHai everyone, let me first give some context.\n\nI've  started to learn code while I was in highschool and even before that  (very simple console apps). I couldn't learn it too much and hadn't much  learning resources for it. After finishing highschool I tried to get in  university abroad, for my CS degree but failed. Later I followed a  different degree and I started to follow an online degree too (Associate  degree in programming) but got burned out easily and I stopped with the  different one and finished the Associate Degree. -Because the first one  had nothing to do with computers.\n\nBefore  finishing, the stuff they teached was kinda easy for me, so I haven't  looked much at the materials and just pass the exams with good marks. I  started to learn Python in 2021 from a tutorial , did some basic apps,  they talked about web frameworks,databases,bots, basic python stuff I've  coded along the tutorials. After learning that tho I hadn't any ideas  to make a big project or so and stopped coding for a while because of  it.\n\nI  tried different tutorials, did some unfinished projects, but got kinda  cold for Python, because my main goal was to finally get a job in tech /  programming.\n\nBefore 2023, I  started to learn with Freecodecamp because it seemed more structured and  because of it I did stick with that. Kinda got excited with the  projects there and I did follow till Front-end libraries.\n\n\\-\"Because after that I didn't want to mess with other services what they say I should use like mongo atlas etc. etc.\"\n\nBefore freecodecamp I tried odinproject, it was nice but there were alot of things I already knew and got bored because of it.\n\nCurrently  I have learned a bit django after being away from python for this long.  But now I kinda feel I forgot stuff like algorithms, data structures  stuff like that.\n\nNow my problem  is, I can't find work, thats ok tho. I understand finding the first work  is hard and I'd have to do some big projects to get some attention. But  I also do not have any project ideas for that. I tried to look in  github for some projects I was interested in but either it was waaay  above my skills ( like a project which they are building and porting for  a new os) or a project written in different languages ( java, c#, ruby /  ruby on rails) (that project was ruby on rails) .\n\nI  also applied for several jobs, some of them being non technical ones  too. I got only reply emails twice (2 years ago I think) and they wanted  someone who could code in Java with Spring,the other one was also about  java.\n\n\\-A lot of the job ads in here are either C# or php btw.\n\nSoo  I'm kinda lost about what to do, first I thought if I could do some  python I'd get a job or find projects after that, but got none, then I  thought React was in trend soo If I'd focus on front-end web dev and  react ( I'm not a fan of web-dev) I'd atleast get some chance to do some  projects; and still nothing.\n\n\\- In react job ads people were looking with +2 +3 years of experience and sometimes also experience with backend too.\n\nWas  thinking to learn C# and .net or Java with Spring so that I have  something what the market in here looks for, but I don't want to waste  time if it doesn't work out. (I'm not saying learning new  stuff(different tools/language/tech) is waste of time, I enjoy learning,  but I should start focusing on getting a job or at least work on real  projects . but not being able to do something with the stuff I learn  kinda does feel like a waste.)\n\nI'm looking for advice :')",

            "selftext": "Note: this is a topic about web development, so I disregarded other types of programming.\n\nWhile I do agree that focusing on just frontend or just backend might make more sense career wise, I also have mixed feeling about the general advice against fullstack path for beginners.\n\nWhy? Well, the main reason is because if you know only front end, and especially if you know only back end, you can never make a full product on your own. The exception to this are some static websites that don't use backend. But in general, if you know just one side you can't make a full product on the web.\n\nAnd being able to make a full product is **important** IMO. For various reasons, such as:\n\n1. by making the whole web application, you get the general idea about how it all works, so even if you specialize later for one side of the things, you'll appreciate and better understand your colleagues who work with the other side. So this is great for education purposes.\n2. It gives you independence and the ability to build actual useful things. Even before you get that first job, you can showcase some apps you built all by yourself.\n3. It can give you motivation to actually go on and build things. You'll likely be less motivated to make an effort if you can't finish the whole thing.\n\nSo, my take, is... I have nothing against specializaiton... But learn at least basics of everything and gain the ability to build things.\n\nI guess the conventional wisdom against fullstack path might indeed hold true for people who just want to get a job ASAP.\n\nBut if you also want to make your own stuff and have some sort of independence, and if the ability to build stuff is what motivates you to learn in the first place, then I think learning at least basics of full stack is a good idea.\n\nWhat's your take about it? Are you learning just to land a job, or you want to gain these \"superpowers\" of being able to build things? What gives you more motivation? For me at least being able to make cool stuff is quite a strong motivating factor.\n\nHave you ever thought about full stack path in this way?",

            "selftext": "So I got this idea actually from a reddit comment I saw a couple of months back when trying to research note-taking techniques and wanted to share it in case it may help others as well. \n\nI've started studying Java again using the textbook \"Introduction to Java Programming\" by David J. Eck, for context. \n\nI've always been a fan of physical notes as I find they help me retain knowledge better and settled on using the Cornell Method, which has helped me a ton in my efficiency and organization. I found this still wasn't enough, and I felt I needed something more, so I stumbled on a reddit comment about uploading their notes onto Github! \n\nSo I found a great guide on markdown, downloaded Github Desktop, VSCode, learned the basics of Git, and this is my current studying technique:\n\n1. Take physical notes in my book using the Cornell Method. \n2. After each section, open up VSCode and type all my notes using markdown. \n3. Upload to a public repository I created on my Github account. \n\nPros:\n\n- I've been retaining my knowledge much more and can recall new things I've learned even after having to take a break due to work. \n- I get to practice using VSCode, Github, and Markdown at the same time. \n- I'm enjoying my note-taking way more and feel really accomplished each time I upload a new section to my repository. \n- I've gotten to teach myself small little things I find really cool, like setting up markdown navigation links, how to embed photos, etc. \n- It's also helped me get the hang of setting up a Readme file, organizing my files properly, and how to troubleshoot some minor Github issues that I've run into. \n\nCons:\n\n- Takes a bit longer, I guess? \n\nI REALLY recommend this to anyone currently studying to try this out, if you haven't already. I've shared my repository with my friends who are only interested in a much more casual way than myself, making sure to cite my sources for them in case they want to delve deeper, and it's been positive reception so far. \n\nI haven't gotten nearly as much done as I'd like to, due to work, but it's been a very rewarding experience so far and makes note taking something I look forward to now.\n\n**Update**: I appreciate all the recommendations! I've installed Obsidian and am using it along with Syncthings now so that I have a constantly updated local version of my notes on both my phone and laptop! The only issue at the moment is that Obsidian is not a recognized text editor on Github Desktop, so it's *slightly* more clunky when committing, but not a big deal at all. I'll be giving Obsidian a solid shot over the next couple months and seeing if I get any value out of it, and if so I'll be keeping it! It's very nice being able to access my notes locally on my phone without needing an internet connection, and this will let me take notes while I'm on break at work now.",

All the configuration for the server (Nginx, PHP & PostgreSQL) has been setup manually by me. Now I am working on a more complex application that will require even more services to be installed on the server (Nginx, PHP, PostgreSQL, Redis and Node) and I want to take advantage of docker to do this.\n\nBasically I am confused with two things:\n\n1. Is it best practice to use docker compose in my case since I have several different services, and if so, how do I manage updates to the compose file or any images without suffering any downtime.\n2. My source code will obviously update more often than my docker container and my current understanding is that I can create a GitHub action to build an image from a base container with my application source code and then push it to a private container repo and then use this image in my production compose file. If this is the case how do I then update the image in the compose file in production, or should I use a base image and mount it as a volume in production as I do in development.\n\nI am happy to take any advice or if anyone is willing to chat I would happily welcome it as I have no experience with docker in production and have lots of questions haha.",

Oh, and I'm also using AI to write the code for me, and I'm just feeding it actions/errors.\n\nHere's the code: \n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <title>Add Text to Image</title>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"canvas-container\">\n          <svg id=\"canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n            <style type=\"text/css\">\n              <![CDATA[\n                #text-element {\n                  font-size: 50px;\n                  fill: black;\n                  text-anchor: middle;\n                }\n              ]]>\n            </style>\n            <image href=\"assets/TestLogo.svg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" />\n            <text id=\"text-element\" x=\"50%\" y=\"550\"></text>\n          </svg>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <input type=\"text\" id=\"text-input\" placeholder=\"Enter your text here\">\n          <button id=\"add-text-button\">Add Text</button>\n          <button id=\"download-button\">Download SVG</button>\n        </div>\n    \n        <script>\n          const canvas = document.getElementById(\"canvas\");\n          const textElement = document.getElementById(\"text-element\");\n          const textInput = document.getElementById(\"text-input\");\n          const addTextButton = document.getElementById(\"add-text-button\");\n          const downloadButton = document.getElementById(\"download-button\");\n    \n          addTextButton.addEventListener(\"click\", addTextToImage);\n    \n          function addTextToImage() {\n            const text = textInput.value;\n            textElement.textContent = text;\n            centerText();\n          }\n    \n          function centerText() {\n            const textWidth = textElement.getComputedTextLength();\n            textElement.setAttribute(\"x\", canvas.clientWidth / 2 - textWidth / 2);\n          }\n    \n          window.addEventListener(\"resize\", centerText);\n    \n          downloadButton.addEventListener(\"click\", downloadSVG);\n    \n          function downloadSVG() {\n            const sourceImage = new Image();\n            sourceImage.crossOrigin = \"anonymous\";\n            sourceImage.onload = function() {\n              const canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\");\n              const context = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n              canvas.width = sourceImage.width;\n              canvas.height = sourceImage.height + 150;\n              context.drawImage(sourceImage, 0, 0);\n              const text = textInput.value;\n              context.font = \"50px Arial\";\n              context.fillStyle = \"black\";\n              context.textAlign = \"center\";\n              context.fillText(text, canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 50);\n              const svgNS = \"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\";\n              const svg = document.createElementNS(svgNS, \"svg\");\n              const foreignObject = document.createElementNS(svgNS, \"foreignObject\");\n              const div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n              div.innerHTML = `<style>svg { background-color: #ffffff }</style>${canvas.toDataURL(\"image/png\")}`;\n              foreignObject.setAttribute(\"width\", \"100%\");\n              foreignObject.setAttribute(\"height\", \"100%\");\n              foreignObject.appendChild(div);\n              svg.setAttribute(\"xmlns\", svgNS);\n              svg.setAttribute(\"width\", canvas.width);\n              svg.setAttribute(\"height\", canvas.height);\n              svg.appendChild(foreignObject);\n              const a = document.createElement(\"a\");\n              a.href = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([svg.outerHTML], {type:\"image/svg+xml\"}));\n              a.target = \"_blank\";\n              a.download = \"text-image.svg\";\n              document.body.appendChild(a);\n              a.click();\n              document.body.removeChild(a);\n              setTimeout(() => {\n                URL.revokeObjectURL(a.href);\n              }, 0);\n            };\n            sourceImage.src = \"assets/TestLogo.svg\";\n          }\n        </script>\n      </body>\n    </\n\nWhen I click the \"Download SVG\" button I get this error in the console:\n\n    Access to image at 'file:///[file path]' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.\n    TestLogo.svg:1          \n\n    Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED\n\nI did a little bit of research and can see CORS is an issue, and I'm not knowledgeable enough to work around this.

Apparently res.redirect redirects POST requests to GET by default (that's why create new items worked fine), but PUT requests are redirected to PUT requests.

I use React Router v6 <Form> component and it works fine with create image form. However, when I try to make an edit form, the page doesn't redirect after submission, the URL stays like /\\[image\\_id\\]/edit?\\_method=PUT and I get 404 error in console. If I go to the main page, the image is changed, so the editing part is working, it's the redirecting that is the issue (as I understand it).\n\nMy EditImage component:\n\n    export default function EditImage(props) {\n      const imgId = useLoaderData();\n      const settings = {\n        action: `/images/${imgId}/edit?_method=PUT`,\n        method: 'POST',\n        buttonText: 'Submit Image',\n        type: \"multipart/form-data\"\n      };\n      return (<>\n        <FormLayout settings={settings}>\n            <Input field=\"image[name]\" labelText=\"Image Name\" type=\"text\"/>\n            <Input field=\"image[image]\" labelText=\"Upload file\" type=\"file\" />\n            <Input field=\"image[user]\" labelText=\"User\" type=\"text\" />\n            <Input field=\"image[description]\" labelText=\"Description\" type=\"text\"/>\n            <Input field=\"image[tags]\" labelText=\"Tags\" type=\"text\"/>\n        </FormLayout>\n    \n    <form action={`/images/${imgId}?_method=DELETE`} method=\"POST\">\n    <Button color=\"red\" text=\"Delete\" />\n    </form>\n    </>\n      );\n    }\n    \n    export async function editImageAction({ request }) {\n    const data = await request.formData();\n    await updateImage(data);\n    return redirect(\"/\")\n    }\n    \n    export async function updateImage(data)\n    { const id = window.location.href.split('/').reverse()[1]\n    const path = '/images/'+id\n    await axios.put(path, data , { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' } });\n    }\n\nNote: <Form Layout> component is just a bit of styling (I use Tailwind) around the react Router <Form> component.\n\nThis is my react routing:\n\n    const router = createBrowserRouter([\n      {\n        path: '/',\n        element: <Layout />,\n        errorElement: <ErrorBoundary />,\n        loader: async () => {\n          const currentUser = await axios.get('/checkAuthentication')\n          return currentUser.data\n        },\n    \n        children: [\n          {\n            index: true,\n            element: <Home />,\n            loader: async () => {\n              const images = await axios.get('/api/images');\n              return images.data;\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            path: 'images/new',\n            element: <NewImage />\n          },\n          {\n            path: 'images',\n            element: <Home />,\n            loader: async ({ params }) => {\n              const image = await axios.get(`/api/images/${params.id}`);\n              return image.data._id;\n            },\n            action: newImageAction\n          },\n          {\n            path: 'images/:id/',\n            element: <EditImage />,\n            loader: async ({ params }) => {\n              const image = await axios.get(`/api/images/${params.id}`);\n              return image.data._id;\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            path: 'images/:id/edit',\n            element: <EditImage />,\n            loader: async ({ params }) => {\n              const image = await axios.get(`/api/images/${params.id}`);\n              return image.data._id;\n            },\n            action: editImageAction\n          },\n          {\n            path: '/register',\n            element: <Register />,\n            action: registerFormAction\n          },\n          {\n            path: '/login',\n            element: <Login />,\n            action: loginFormAction\n          },\n          {\n            path: '*',\n            element: <NotFound />\n          },\n        ], \n      },\n    ]);\n\nMy backend routes:\n\n    router.route('/:id')\n        .put(isLoggedIn, upload.array('image[image]'), catchAsync(images.updateImage))\n        .delete(isLoggedIn, catchAsync(images.deleteImage));\n\nAnd the updateImage controller:\n\n    module.exports.updateImage = async (req, res, next) => {\n        const { id } = req.params;\n        const image = await Image.findByIdAndUpdate(id, { ...req.body.image });\n        const imgs = req.files.map(f => ({ url: f.path, filename: f.filename })) || imgs;\n        image.images.push(...imgs);\n        image.tags = req.body.image.tags.split(', ') || image.tags\n        await image.save();\n        if (req.body.deleteImages) {\n            for (let filename of req.body.deleteImages) {\n                await cloudinary.uploader.destroy(filename);\n            }\n            await image.updateOne({ $pull: { images: { filename: { $in: req.body.deleteImages } } } })\n        }\n        res.redirect('/')\n    }\n\nI'm lost at which direction even look at. This is my first coding question I've ever asked, so I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions. I'm not looking for a specific coding solution, just trying to understand what got wrong here. I'm a beginner and that's my first proper project I'm trying to work on.\n\nMy guess is that I don't fully understand how this react routing works. Before React I had the same thing written with just Node/Express routes and it was pretty straight forward for me (even though I'm still learning). Now I have no ideas where to even look to debug this. Especially since as I said, the editing itself works. And redirect logic is literally just the \"redirect\" line and it is working for the creating images that set up pretty similarly.\n\nI would appreciate any help. Thank you!",

Sometimes I'll write the correct code but it'll take me ages and sometimes I'll just be completely lost. \n\nI also tend to write a lot of pseudo code on the side and translating them to python code could get very annoying for me. \n\nI also realized that I have a problem visualizing the code at times even with provided examples on the docstrings. I do not know what to do, do I just have to keep practicing, or do I somehow need to change up my studying habit for python? Studying for midterms is such a hassle as I just keep finding myself staring at one empty function body for hours trying to figure out what to do.

I didn't bother with Freecodecamp and The Odin Project because I am a visual learner and I got stuck on the first part on both and didn't know that to do or who to ask. I am looking for a bootcamp that's free or Max $10k, teaches one even the bear minimum to get a job into coding, and the curriculum is mostly Video and Audio. I could learn the rest on my own I believe but for now idk where to start and what to learn! Just like learning anything the first stage/step is the hardest! By the way do y'all think if I get a software engineering degree I could potentially find a job without a coding bootcamp or networking. I  already have a nursing degree from out of the states so i don't use it because it not accepted here in America and tbh I hardly learned much but I've currently been a therapist for the last year and I could go back to school and do a second degree program it would take a year or 18 months.",

How I ended up on this path is a story in itself, I have always dabbled with computers(networking mostly) and have always been the \"computer nerd\" in my circles though I am no expert by any means. I always tried to shy away from this but after enduring some challenges and a few major life events, I decided maybe I should utilize and build on this skill after all.\n\nMy love is cyber security, I am currently studying to take my CompTIA A+ while also studying python. After my A+ I intended to pursue other certifications such as my Security+ and so forth, my end goal is to be an Ethical Hacker/Penetration Tester.\n\n\nIf you made it this far, I am just seeking people looking to get their start as well, I want to hear about your journey or whatever cool things you learned that maybe you wanna share or tell someone about. Let's keep each other honest about our goals and encourage one another, I'm sure a lot of you know how lonely this journey can be sometime.

However, I don't fully understand the logic. For example, when you put in 3, the output is 3 2 1 0 1 2 3. \n\n1. up\\_and\\_down(3) is called, 3 is printed out, the condition evaluates to true\n2. up\\_and\\_down(2) is called, 2 is printed out, the condition evaluates to true\n3. up\\_and\\_down(1) is called, 1 is printed out, the condition evaluates to true\n4. up\\_and\\_down(0) is called, 0 is printed out, the condition evaluates to false\n\nI understand it this far. However, what happens now is what confuses me. For me, the logical conclusion would be: if (n) is no longer true, the code block does not execute again, and the program terminates. \n\nWhy does the function now print out 1 2 3? How does n go back up from 0? From what I've read, this is called unwinding the stack, but I just don't get how it works.\n\nThanks in advance!",

For example the same exercise can be made with a for loop, or maybe with a built in method, or maybe other solutions. I came to realize that there are many different ways to achieve the same solution to a program. If until now my focus was like \u201cok, you have this problem. Decompose it, solve the single parts and then stick everything together\u201d now I start to wonder \u201cbut which action should I pursue? And why? What is the purpose of programming? Yes, practically is \u201cinput in\u2014-> give meaning to inputs\u2014-> output\u201d but which direction do I choose? Do I look for less syntax? Shorter code? Maybe it\u2019s a trade off between everything?\u201d Maybe these are concepts that I\u2019ve not covered yet (does this have anything to do with DS&A?) and it\u2019s too early to think about it but I start to feel the urge to expand my knowledge and know better where I\u2019m going.\n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hello. I took multiple classes in college that taught python, mainly for data analysis. I've forgotten all of it. I've been trying to teach myself HTML - and even have been building a website using neocities so that I can put what I'm learning in practice - a test website for something I do actually want to create - and I've been using freecodecamp. The problem is, I find it incredibly hard to just retain the information that I'm learning. Like, I keep forgetting how to properly anchor an image. Or how to use CSS properly. Or, like, is top/bottom or left/right the first in a margin shortcut? And so on. Heck, I don't even know if the examples I just gave even make sense or if my knowledge has atrophied that bad.\n\nI also don't have much time to learn how to code - I'm a student, and I'm going to be a law student next year, I work a job on the side, so some weeks I simply cannot find the motivation or time to pull up freecodecamp, or my website, and suddenly I'm on the 5th project in freecodecamp but forgot even the basics I learned in the first one. \n\nAny suggestions for how to actually retain information? Every time I've tried learning to code, I forget nearly everything. I know the most obvious one is to work at it consistently and don't take too long of a break, to practice, to repeat things, to encode it into memory, but I struggle a lot less with, say, learning a new language on Duolingo, where I feel I'm making a lot more progress, and even remember a lot more despite making Duo sad and not opening the app for four weeks. Any suggestions for people who overcame the same issue, or for people who may have ideas on how to make learning easier? I really want to stick with HTML for now, but I do want to learn more languages going forward.",

I do understand the \u201chint\u201d the book said, as I would\u2019ve expected all numbers divisible by 2 and 3 to be in the output and I can\u2019t grasp how \u2018break\u2019 changes this - although it obviously does? Does the break just mean that it stops after the first time j %2 == 0 and then again after the first time j %3 ==0? \n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Hey people,\n\nI wanted to reach out to people already in the programming field and see if could get some answers on how to get started on the path. I currently don't go to school I just work a lot but also have a good amount of free time for studying, I'm about to be 22 years old.\n\nI am currently learning both java and python on code academy, highly recommend it to those looking to get into programming. I wanted to ask folks what language I should learn to get good at web-dev, both front and back end. I could stick to python and java but if anyone has any recommendations that would be much appreciated. I just don't want to continue on learning these two and then not use them much. I really don't mind starting fresh on a new language if it'll better my chances of success in first and foremost being able to carry out my tasks and secondly getting a job.\n\nI want to move onto software development in the future. I just am focusing on web-dev now to get my foot in the door, I still want to have a very good handle on it though and be able to do anything that is asked of and take on any projects that I wish to. If y'all think learning soft-dev right off the bat is a better idea just let me know!\n\nI am open to all and any ideas. I am very discipline and really want to get into these spaces as soon as I can. I am not planning on rushing anything, just going to relay on hard work to get where I want to be, so really I would love any and all advice!\n\nThanks a lot and I hope this can help some people along with my self :))\n\nPs. I understand this kind of help is asked for regularly,\"What language should I learn if I'm just getting started?\", but I feel my request is a little more specific and can would definitely appreciate help myself and it's possible others may as well.",

Using the binomial theorem:\n\n    sqrt(1-x^2) = 1 + 0.5(-x^2)^1 + (0.5(0.5-1)/2)(-x^2)^2 + (0.5(0.5-1)(0.5-2)/(2*3))(-x^2)^3 + ...\n    or\n    sqrt(1-x^2) = 1 + 0.5(x^2)(-1)^1 + (0.5(0.5-1)/2)(x^4)(-1)^2 + (0.5(0.5-1)(0.5-2)/(2*3))(x^6)(-1)^3 + ...\n\nAfter Integrating, I get:\n\n    pi/4 = 1 + (0.5/3)*(-1)^1 + (0.5(0.5-1)/(2*5))*(-1)^2 + (0.5(0.5-1)(0.5-2)/(2*3*7))*(-1)^3 + ...\n\nNow I am implementing this in Python as follows:\n\n    y=1\n    n=1 \n    for i in range(0,20000,1):\n        for m in range(0,i,1):\n            y*=((0.5-m)/(m+1))\n        n+=y*(((-1)**(1+i))/(2*i + 3))\n    print(4*n)\n\nHere the first digit \"1\" is initialised along n, and others are implemented using a loop\n\nSince all the digits of the series will turn to be negative, the approximation should always be a bit more than pi, and never less\n\nBut, what I get as an output is 3.1005906610457403 for 20,000 terms of this series, which is fairly *lower* than pi..\n\nSo, what am I doing wrong over here? Any help is appreciated\n\nEDIT: Seems like the code does not output the intended series at all, and the value does not (effectively) change after 11 steps: https://imgur.com/A7ezMek (image shows values of `n` after each iteration)\n\n\nThis is what the series *should* output: https://imgur.com/g8luMvu\n\nBut I do not understand where did I go wrong, why is it not outputting the series at all",

I'm still very new to programming so my skills are still very new. I was surprised I was able to land this internship, and I was excited. My first day comes, and I had this idea that I was gonna get a proper introduction to the different platforms they use, but they just showed me what they used, but not how to actually use it. So, even now I'm not exactly sure what all these things I have downloaded on my computer does. Within my first day, I was already given an assignment to do, which isn't something simple. And way out of my knowledge and skills. I wasn't even expecting to get anything maybe for the next couple of weeks, I thought I was going to be provided with some training, like watch how they do task and give me small tasks while they watch me. But, my first assignment they gave me an assignment where I had to add a functionality into their existing code! I was freaked out cause of course I don't know. I don't even know what their existing code does. I let my mentor know, I don't know how to complete it. And they were nice enough to help me, but throughout the assignment I can tell they were getting annoyed of my questions because of course I was asking some pretty stupid questions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I got the wrong exception with this internship. I don't know if this normal for an internship, since its my first one. I haven't gotten back to my internship this week, because I already had an existing out of town plans that they had let me go on. So I'll be back next week, but I'm worried and dreading it. I don't even feel like learning with the amount of pressure being put on me. Am just complaining too much? is this suppose to be normal?",

I don't think the issue is with my code, but I'm still going to post it because I'm getting more desperate (***Python***):\n\n    import pygame, readchar, math\n    \n    pygame.init()\n    \n    Wid = 1920 / 3\n    Hig = 1080 / 3\n    \n    WIN = pygame.display.set_mode((Wid, Hig))\n    \n    Clk = pygame.time.Clock()\n    \n    # defines the vertices of the cube\n    cube_vertices = [\n        (-1, 1, 1),  # 0\n        (1, 1, 1),  # 1\n        (1, -1, 1),  # 2\n        (-1, -1, 1),  # 3\n        (-1, -1, -1),  # 4\n        (1, -1, -1),  # 5\n        (1, 1, -1),  # 6\n        (-1, 1, -1)]  # 7\n    \n    # defines the faces of the cube\n    cube_faces = [(0, 1, 2, 3),  # front  0\n             (0, 3, 4, 7),  # left   1\n             (7, 6, 5, 4),  # back   2\n             (0, 1, 6, 7),  # top    3\n             (1, 6, 5, 2),  # right  4\n             (2, 3, 4, 5)]  # bottom 5\n    \n    Pitch = 0\n    Yaw = 0\n    \n    Run = True\n    \n    while Run:\n      for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                Run = False\n    \n      WIN.fill((0, 0, 0))\n    \n      if readchar.readchar() == \"w\":\n        Pitch = Pitch + 1\n      elif readchar.readchar() == \"s\":\n        Pitch = Pitch - 1\n      if readchar.readchar() == \"a\":\n        Yaw = Yaw + 1\n      elif readchar.readchar() == \"d\":\n        Yaw = Yaw - 1\n    \n      for K in range(len(cube_faces)):\n        X_temp = []\n        Y_temp = []\n        for J in range(4):\n          Xv = cube_vertices[cube_faces[K][J]][0]\n          Yv = cube_vertices[cube_faces[K][J]][1]\n          Zv = cube_vertices[cube_faces[K][J]][2] + 100\n          # around y\n          Xv = math.cos(Yaw) * Xv + math.sin(Yaw) * Zv\n          Zv = -1 * math.sin(Yaw) * Xv + math.cos(Yaw) * Zv\n          # around x\n          Yv = math.cos(Pitch) * Yv + -1 * math.sin(Pitch) * Zv\n          Zv = math.sin(Pitch) * Yv + math.cos(Pitch) * Zv\n          # perspective projection\n          Xv = (Xv / Zv + Wid / 2) * 5\n          Yv = (Yv / Zv + Hig / 2) * 5\n          # append each value into list\n          X_temp.append(Xv)\n          Y_temp.append(Yv)\n            \n        pygame.draw.polygon(WIN, (250, 250, 250), [[X_temp[0], Y_temp[0]],\n                                                   [X_temp[1], Y_temp[1]],\n                                                   [X_temp[2], Y_temp[2]],\n                                                   [X_temp[3], Y_temp[3]]], 50)\n      \n      pygame.display.update()\n      Clk.tick(60)",

I couldn't put myObj\\[name\\]. In this case the quotes on the property are necessary in some form or another, i.e., in literal string form or through a variable. Maybe not the best example, I guess, but im saying that quotes have an effect on how the text is interpreted.\n\nSo why in this next case, is it that the quotes which are used to create an html string variable, do these quotes not remain IN PLACE when I append the html string value, to my div element with an id of output?

I have started TOP and found it to be pretty straightforward. The problem I'm currently having is not completely ending other tasks and work which causes me to bleed into the time I carved out for TOP. \n\nI believe that this is because I haven't \"put\" anything in to make me 100% commit, unlike other things that I have going on in my life like working and running a business.\n\nI know that once I have a course that is structured, planned, and paid for I will be able to commit.\n\n\nIf anyone has any ideas please let me know, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnd for those who are going to comment that if I can't find time now that I won't find time later...this is not an issue of time but an issue of procrastination because I know the course is literally at your own pace and 100% free.",

But I can help fill in and guide you along your learning journey, depending on what stage you're at, ideally I'd like to set up something where I can help people on a longer-term basis.\n\nI know that coding can feel like an overwhelming sea of knowledge and sometimes the smallest amount of information in a 1-1 setting can help a lot!\n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in helping those who are already further along in their learning and/or outside the US or have a non-traditional background.\n\nBUT- idk where this is gonna go. So if you have a traditional CS degree type profile, or if you feel like you could use some mentoring in a different way, just message me anyways :) right now I wanna see what people need help with the most.\n\nWe can just start with a message and if I can actually help you then I\u2019d like to do a zoom call. Ideally I\u2019m looking for people who would want to setup something that\u2019s a longer relationship, since I think that would be the most impactful.\n\nAbout me: I\u2019m a self-taught dev w/o a CS degree. I started my career before boot camps existed (circa 2010) and managed to get a job in San Francisco after more than a year of self-study. It was definitely a different job market in those years. I think it was a bit easier back then- there were fewer qualified junior devs- but also harder because I had to figure everything out myself. I've been teaching for a while now and most recently I was helping to start and run a coding bootcamp in Singapore. So I have a lot of experience teaching people to code and I\u2019ve seen a lot about what qualities makes someone successful in the field. If you want to know any more about me you can search my github and linkedin which are the same as my user.\n\nWhy I\u2019m doing this: I\u2019m not in a job right now, and for my next job I\u2019ll be going back to dev work. I miss helping people and being in that learning atmosphere. And also, for me personally, teaching has been one of the most impactful things I\u2019ve done in my career- in terms of developing raw coding skill (being forced to deeply learn something in order to explain it to others) and also in terms of seeing a bit behind the scenes of how people get hired. Just so you all know I\u2019m not doing this only out of the kindness of my heart ;)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, email me at awong \\[at\\] a15i.net mention the name of this subreddit in the subject. In the email describe where you are in your coding journey, a little about yourself and your background, and what your goals are. I want to reply to everyone who messages :)  \n\n\nEDIT: current email count: about 70, but I'm still intending to reply to everyone eventually- it'll just take me a bit of time :) ",

I want to learn how to create a gui program that can be used to receive/output data for micro controllers.\n\nSo I started learning c++ in my free time since I had already started learning to program arduinos at home. But there's one problem, the at work environments are all on Linux (Ubuntu) and I've spent 2 weeks trying to get the most basic application window to compile and run and for some reason the linker just doesn't want to work. I'm getting frustrated with this and there's not much information online about vscode for linux or c++ on Linux in general.\n\nI figure there's two good options for how I can get past this roadblock and continue my learning.\n\n1. Dual boot windows and learn c++ (not ideal as I'd have to restart my PC every time I needed to do my work)\n\n2. Learn python on Linux (from what I've read because of the interpreter it's the exact same as learning python for windows?)\n\nIf anyone with experience can give me some insight I would greatly greatly appreciate it.

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI am graduating this April from the University of Michigan with a BA in Cognitive Science. I know a bit of python and am a TA in a python class and have grown to love coding. However, I have much more to learn before I can get a job in tech.\n\nI have been struggling to decide what to do with my life for the past year. To keep my options open I applied to a master's program. I got accepted to the Roux Institute at Northeastern's Master of CS program (they have a special align program for people without a cs background). Luckily I was able to push back the decision date until my financial package is released, but I need to make a decision this month. They guarantee a $55,000 scholarship, making the tuition for the three-ish years only about $20k (not 100% sure until I get my package, but it will be <= 20k). I would be moving back home for three years which I am not exactly enthused about. In addition, I have very little in savings so it would be a struggle to not have time to work for such a long period.\n\nI am attracted to Bootcamp mostly because it is quicker, and I would likely be able to get a job and live on my own much sooner. Also, 3 more years of school is a big commitment since I am just now graduating from 4 years of undergrad. I am a woman so most of the boot camps offer good scholarships which is attractive. Part of me just wants to start working ASAP, but I also am not sure if the master's is a better investment. The price difference is not significant.\n\nI listed the pros and cons (shown below), but no option is the obvious right one. If anyone has any thoughts on my situation, personal experiences, or recommendations, please let me know. At the end of the day, I just want to get a well-paying job in tech (in a good location).\n\n**PROS/CONS**\n\n**Masters in CS at Northeastern**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- More prestigious degree\n\n\\- Can live at home (low COL)\n\n\\- Affordable for a masters\n\n\\- Northeastern co-op model/network\n\n\\- Results in a deeper understanding of CS (not just surface level)\n\n\\- Seems easier to find a high-paying job after graduation?\n\n\\- In-person\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Almost 3 years\n\n\\- Have to live at home\n\n\\- Likely cannot work while doing this (I could do part-time school but I don't want to spend significantly more than 3 years before I can get an FT job)\n\n\\- New program, not a ton of info from students\n\n\\- Seems to be a lot of working professionals returning to school... I'm 21\n\n**Bootcamp**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Fast \n\n\\- Would (hopefully) only have to live at home for a short period\n\n\\- Good scholarships for women\n\n\\- Have a lot of family who have been successful with these\n\n\\- Not as big of a commitment\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\-  Not an actual degree\n\n\\- Less thorough, more surface level\n\n\\- Lots of sketchy boot camps out there\n\n\\- Seems riskier? almost too good to be true?\n\n\\- Harder to find a job\n\n\\- Online\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Followup Thought\n\nPart of the reason I am so hesitant about the Masters's degree is that I am repeatedly being told (by connections in the field) that you don't really need a degree to break into tech, and that the most relevant thing is just to learn on the job. However, I don't see how I could get a job (in coding) without one of these options. Bootcamp seems to teach you the same skills you would acquire being self-taught but is just structured which I would need. However, it seems really difficult to get a job this way and seems like it can make things more difficult down the line. The Master's is obviously going to give me the best reputation and knowledge, but I am doubting if it's necessary/worth the time.",

I also have some basic knowledge of Python (as in I worked a bit with requests, selenium, file management, data structures etc). To add to this, basic css, html, boostrap starting from 2.\\* up to 5.\\* and some SQL. Javascript code I can write using stackoverflow :lol:.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really want to get a job in the field and since my finances are better now, I want to get started somewhere. I researched a bit and found some coding bootcamps and Le wagon (based on their reviews and what I could find on the internet) seems to be a good option. Bit expensive, but hey, as soon as I learn something from it. However, searching reddit there seem to be 2-3 accounts that post on every Le Wagon related post that they are a big scam, that you don't learn that much etc. I was wondering if anyone has some advice to give here. Should I go for it, should I try and learn everything myself? My goal is to reach junior level and to be able to land a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Anyway, I have been learning some C and have been learning how to link multiple source files together with the compiler (gcc).\n\nSo my goal here is to break up my potential source files into smaller files and pass a couple variables between source files. Like I said above, I'm very new to programming so if this is a bad strategy or if there is an easier/standard way to do this I would love an explanation on that.\n\nBased on a couple google searches, the way to share a structure between source files is to add said structure to a header file, and include said header in all needed source files.\n\nSo here are my example files:\n\none.c\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    \n    #include \"defs.h\"\n    \n    int main(void)\n    {\n    \tfoofoo.num = 1;\n    \tfoo();\n    \tprintf(\"%d\",foofoo.num);\n    \n            return 0;\n    }\n\ntwo.c\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    \n    #include \"defs.h\"\n    \n    void foo(void)\n    {\n    \tfoofoo.num = foofoo.num + 10;\n    }\n\nand defs.h\n\n    #ifndef _DEFS_H\n    #define _DEFS_H\n    \n    struct foofoo {\n    \tint num;\n    }foofoo;\n    \n    \n    void foo(void);\n    \n    #endif\n\nMy expectation is that I can access the structure foofoo from inside whatever source file has defs.h included. But the problem I'm running into is that gcc tells me foofoo has multiple definitions.\n\nIs this not what the include guards are for? Am I using them wrong? Is there a better or safer strategy? Do I need to use a pointer?\n\nAny help would be great, thanks.",

(Reading the programmatic programmer really inspired me to \"be better\" as a dev - and this is one area I am focusing right now)\n\nAnyways: basically, we want to track which of our email list members have gone into certain campaigns in our Mailchimp email marketing software.\n\nSo we basically have two tables that are relevant in our own database (Not mailchimp - although it essentially stores this data too.)\n\ntable 1: Contacts. This just contains things like email, name, etc.\n\ntable 2: Campaigns. This just stores the \"campaign ID\" (from mailchimp) and gives a basic description on what that campaign is about.\n\nSo I need to create a 3rd table that essentially keeps a log of which contacts have been added to which campaigns, and when.\n\n**Is there a certain naming convention to follow here?**\n\nWould \"Log\" or \"Event\" be appropriate?\n\nMy first go to name for this new table would be something like \"contactsAddedToCampaignsEventLog\" or something.... it makes sense, but it seems burdensome.\n\nIf you've gotten this far - thank you for reading :)",

And im looking at courses with javascript as the core   for Fullstack, but im a bit worried it will be lots of design and not code?\n\nThe things im learning in C# seems very difficult compared to javascript but i suppose that comes with the fact that i can build more stuff with it.\n\nOkay i realize i still havent produced a good question yet, how the hell do you know what jobs there are when you cant even grasp what you are getting into yet?\n\nAnd lastly, i think i have managed to form an idea of what i would consider fun in coding: are there jobs in coding that are the coding equal to putting together IKEA furniture without having to think of design yourself? Just putting stuff together.\n\nThat may sound boring as fuck to some, but its what i envision in my head to be rather satisfying.\n\nThanks, and sorry for the incoherent newly",

For my own projects, I would deploy this to PythonAnywhere (previously Heroku) using a free hobby account, but I don't think this would be the way for a real client, right? Where would their backend be hosted, how would payment for that service be negotiated, and how would this be managed? I've recently learned about using WordPress as a headless CMS, so maybe this is an easier solution? But they would still need to pay for the domain, webhost, etc., right? Or maybe for these kinds of free-beginner-freelance projects, I should stick to front-end only? Am I overthinking this?",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nHope anyone reading this is well. I have a very complex problem and was wondering if anyone could help here, or recognises doing a similar data splitting, before I go somewhere else. I have some failed attempts which I can show if anyone wants to see them (don't laugh at them haha). If anyone wants to attempt this let me know and we can work through it together.\n\nI have a dataset for machine learning, but I want to change it so it is a proportional split. Let me explain a little. This is a small sample of the dataset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|cmp1|Temperature, K|Viscosity, Pa;s|C-C-|C-C-N-|\\+N-C-C@C@|C-C@N@|N-C-C@C@|C-N-|C-N@N@|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ABkcNQ|293.15|250|2|3|0|0|0|1|0|\n|ABkcNQ|300.00|188|2|3|0|0|0|1|0|\n|ABnNLc|293.15|155|2|3|0|0|0|1|0|\n|AAhevu|283.15|140|1|1|1|2|1|1|1|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'cmp1' represents a molecule, with a unique key for each molecule. Viscosity is the output for the neural network. There is a 'Temperature, K' column. This represents the number of data points a molecule may have (some of them have as much as 500 data points, and some as little as 5 or even just a single point). There rest of the columns, 'C-C' and onwards is something called a group contribution which represents what is present in a molecule and what isn't.\n\nSo now we understand the dataset, there are 2 conditions of the splitting which I have been attempting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is ensuring all the molecules are split proportionally, especially for the single data points.  \nThis is an example of the logic behind it. If I have 100 molecules with a single data point, and my splitting is 0.95 to training and 0.05 for testing, it will be split as 95 molecules to training and 5 to testing.  \nFor 100 molecules with 2 data points, there will be 200 data points in between them. First, each of them should be split (with a randomiser to ensure it isn't an ordered split) with the 0.95 split and round down. So for example this will leave 1 data point for training and 1 for testing for each molecule. If there was 3, it would split as 2 and 1. This will leave 100 molecules with a data point in between them. Now, due to splitting the molecules, we can split this data by doubling the training data. So this remaining 100 molecules are split with 0.9. This will leave 90 data points behind. Therefore, in total there will be 190 data points for training and 10 for testing. This is proportional to a 0.95 for all 200 data points. The formula behind this would be (correct me if I'm wrong),\n\nT = ((n\\_dp \\* 0.95)  - (math.floor(n\\_group \\* 0.95) \\* n\\_mol))) / n\\_mol\n\nT is the training split for the rest of the data. So for the remaining data after doing the rounding split for each molecule.\n\nI want to apply this for all molecules. If anyone needs me to explain the logic behind it further, let me know.\n\nThe second condition is to sum all the non zero cells in each column of the group contributions ('C-C' etc). I'm trying to set a criteria to ensure it is split (with round down) according to the feature. For example, if there are 4 non zero cells in one of these columns, I am trying to set a criteria that there will always be 3 data points in training.\n\nThank you for taking the time to reading this, and if there needs anymore clarification, let me know.

Been using Unity and Unreal since 2018, well versed in C# and C++ (obviously in a Game Dev scenario) and know my way around Java pretty well too, so the core principles around programming is there (things like OOP, general terminology and structures/design principles). I want to get into more though. \n\nI completed a Bachelors tailored towards Game Development and it touched a bit on UI/UX programming and some web dev in Vim (first year stuff tho so I can\u2019t remember too much). But I\u2019m now looking for work and feel like I would have better chances in Web Dev or some form of Full Stack development- where do I start? I find youtube is a bit difficult to learn from and would rather have textbooks to learn from. The process does seem somewhat intimidating as well though, but that could easily come just from my lack of experience with this specific side of programming - so any tips or guides to help get me started would be amazing.

Is there another java package for Lists that I need to import? I'm so confused because I have literally copied the code that the lesson told me to use. \n\nI'm wondering if I've entered the code for the readEmployees() method in the wrong place and accidentally messed up my brackets, because there was some ambiguity in the lesson about where that code should be entered, in reference to the main method (like I said, I'm very new to coding and don't yet understand all of the nuances of syntax).\n\nAny help would be hugely appreciated. Also I can send over the full lesson PDF if that would help to add context.",

I know its not an actual website because it can only be accessed from the computers at work. The part I am confused on is how does this code get executed? Whenever I have something to be run locally in the past, I have had to start up a local server (ex: npm run dev) and go into localhost (localhost:8000) into the browser, and if I were to close my IDE the server shuts down as well. If someone could point me to where I can learn more about what is going on in the background to accomplish this, I would really appreciate it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*If there is any information missing that I need to include, let me know.

About once a year I try to get into learning programming language (every single time with a different language) and every time I seem to last about a week before I find it to fruistrating or I can't find something to apply it to at work. \n\nAt work we are about to exit our last physical DC and transition fully into Azure which is why I'm trying to get back into it. I'm confident in Powershell and the basic concepts of a language. \n\n**What I want to achieve**\n\n* Our team is a \"made up\" SRE team. By that we have Developers and Cloud Engineers both working in the same team. I'd like to be able to help understand developer problems\n* Career advancement - Obviously a large component \n* Just be able to \"talk\" to other development teams without just thinking well this should be easy\n\n\n**Languages I'm considering**\n\n* C# - One of the main languages we use at work (All M$ shop)\n* NodeJS/React - Another language used for webapps at work\n* Python - Lots of tutorials, career progression \n* Go - Seems to be a pretty big up and comer, Azure doesn't treat it as a first class language \n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n* Suggestions on what language I should tackle. I'm looking at Go -> Node -> Python -> C#. This obviously doesn't tackle my first point very well \n* A guide/course that will start quickly at the beginning and go over how to implement concepts, but not spend an hour on a foreach loop or if else statements \n\nThanks for your time",

It's very unrewarding when you can't solve it, but very rewarding when you do that. I'm not a LC type as I like concepts that resembles life and it's not easy for me to make a sentence that consists both fun and LC but I guess it was somewhat fun. It was like these moments when you implement bubble sort by yourself without knowing it's a bubble sort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tackled LC like somebody told me. Don't even try. Just read solutions and try to understand them. But most of the solutions are cringy one liners completely useless for beginners. Unless you want to scroll far for those without upvotes and made by other beginners. So that didn't help much. I did challenges that are easier than LC easy. Then I normally don't like watching any videos as that's so slow comparing to reading, but in this case it was actually useful. I watched many videos others solving LC and talking about that and it helped.

My stress is destroying me. I talk to my junior friends and they do not feel any stress at all and things they do just makes sense. I love C# programming and I really want to do it.

            "selftext": "Hello, I have a problem related to the lock file concept. The actual problem is trivial to present, but so that you understand me well, I will present the entirety of the programs in which it occurs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have two programs: client.cpp and server.cpp.\n\nThe idea is that the server runs in an infinite loop \"listening\" for incoming messages from the client and responding to them. The client, on the other hand, is supposed to read the text entered into the terminal and send it to the server, after which it receives and displays its response.\n\nOne server and potentially x clients are running at the same time.\n\nThe client, after reading the text I entered, saves it to a txt file, the name of which I give when starting the program, and then checks in a loop whether the lock file exists. If so, it waits until the lock file no longer exists, if not, it creates a new lock file \"locker.lock\" and puts the name of the file with its message in the file \"serverBuffer.txt\".\n\nServer checks in a loop if the lock file exists. If so, it opens and reads from its buffer what file to open to read a message from a particular client. It prints the client's message in the terminal and asks for input, for a response. It then overwrites the client file with its message, deletes the lock file, and returns to the beginning of the loop, waiting for a new lock file.\n\nThe client that sent the message waited for a response, checking in a loop every 4 seconds if the lock file exists. If not, it opens its text file where it expects to see a message from the server.\n\nNow we get to the heart of the problem - if I run one client and server, everything works fine. But if there are two, three or more clients, the first client who sent their message may not see it at all after receiving a reply. The server will remove the lock file blocking the first client from reading the response, but one of the other clients may manage to create another lock file in order to send the message to the server before first client can react.\n\nThe result is that despite having a response in the client file, the client may unnecessarily wait until everyone gets answers from server <=> until the lock file expires long enough for everyone to take note and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong description, perhaps unnecessarily, but I wanted to be precise. Finally, the question - how do you think this problem can be solved? I tried in two ways:\n\n1. Increase the time between checking if the lock file exists and creating a new one.\n2. Instead of checking if the lock file exists, before reading the response from the server, I checked if the client file was modified.\n\nBoth of these ideas failed, so I am writing this with hope someone can give me a hint, what is the proper solution in such situation.",

            "selftext": "Background: I'm learning TypeScript/JavaScript and I was thinking it would be better to localize the learning process and projects/examples from going along with my textbook in a Python environment - specifically using conda.\n\nThis is further supported by the fact that the textbook calls for version v.14.15.4 for Node.js when my OS's (KDE Neon) Node.js seems to be v12.22.x. (And I can't seem to build the required Node version due to some required packages in the process being deprecated. I'd need to install a different Python version, and at that point I'm already making a virutal env.)\n\nSo, I start with `conda create -n ts_learn_env pip` to create the env and install pip into it. After activating this new env, I run `pip install nodeenv` to allow for actually dealing with node versioning and all of that.\n\nNext, I run `mkdir ~/ts_learn` to use as the pseudo-root of the textbook's projects/examples.\n\nI then run `nodeenv install --node=14.15.4` , which gets me the relevant version of npm as well. Fantastic.\n\nFrom here, it seems that any modifications made through `npm config edit` or `npm set` result in a file at `~/.npmrc` reflecting those changes, but I would like to keep this file either under `$CONDA_PREFIX` or `~/ts_learn`.\n\nIf I change the location of `~/.npmrc` to either of those directories, then npm \"forgets\" the changes and just makes a new one in the same location.\n\nIf I keep it there, then it allows for the changes to persist, and further installations can be kept under `$CONDA_PREFIX` or `~/ts_learn`, so it might not matter since I won't really be messing with mulitple Node versions anyway, but how could I improve this for the better localization short of getting a Docker container with the required image?",

            "selftext": "I'm a bit frustrated where I'm at  with my job, and I'm terrified that if I ever lose it, I won't be able to get hired anywhere else.\n\nFor some context, I worked at a non-dev role at my company for a few years, and was self-learning development on the side. I built some bots, dabbled in game design, took a lot of courses, but was kind of scattered in my learning. My company then provided an opportunity for a less-than-junior developer role where you'd have a chance to grow into a permanent junior dev role. I decided to apply on a whim, assuming I wouldn't get the gig, but might use it as a learning opportunity. Surprise surprise, I made it through the interview and the code challenge and was placed on a team not of my choosing.\n\nThe team I was placed on is a back-end infrastructure team. Everyone on my team is very smart about all aspects of the product and how it fits in with the larger ecosystem. They approve code coming in from all over the company and know how to debug when things go wrong.\n\nTwo years on, I've since completed the program and have been placed on the team as a permanent software engineer for about a year. I barely write code. I'm expected to do code reviews that can touch on anything from PHP, React, Bash script, Typescript and more, as well as manage the infrastructure for our very convoluted repository. There are very brief moments where I feel like things work for me, like when I have to build tooling that other developers use, and I've gotten quite handy at shell scripting.\n\nLargely though, I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I can't tell what skills I'm building towards. My team is also responsible for unowned code in the repo, and to this day I still can't solve issues that come through that our team is supposed to handle. What's really scary to me is I don't really care. I have no big interest in learning this product deeply. I'd rather stick to the lower level bash stuff and not deal with the product itself.\n\nI get little to no feedback about how I'm doing. When I ask, I'm told \"I'm doing just fine and to keep doing what I'm doing.\" For extra lols, they actually made me a team lead at one point. I actually wasn't too bad at the project management side of things, but I lacked the technical knowledge to make confident decisions my team needs to make. Three months later I begged them to let me return to an IC role so I could have more time to grow. I became terrified that if I ever lost my job (because ya know, the tech industry right now) I wouldn't have enough experience to get a job literally anywhere else. They thankfully agreed, but now I just feel aimless and no one is really giving me work to do, I have to find it myself (and I'm still kind of defacto leading the team anyway for \\_other\\_ reasons).\n\nAnyway, this is a long post. I just needed to vent. I don't feel like I have anyone at my company I'm friends enough with to vent honestly about and needed to scream into the void of other programmers. \n\nHave you ever been in this position where you just feel...devoid of joy at your programming job and aimless? How do you get that spark back? Or how can I try and grow in a way that protects myself if I ever lose my job? I do have some side projects I work on sporadically, but nothing that I'd say is resume noteworthy.",

That will work, but it's O(N) complexity. Although the points are close enough together (say within a 50-mile radius?) that I can likely get away with computing the distance with something slightly less accurate but more efficient than the usual  [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) (thereby avoid some serious trig function foo). But it's still going to be a full N distance calculations each time.\n\nIntuitively, I suspect there's a way to not have to traverse the whole list each and every round: maybe by pre-sorting the array of stored points by their location in a 2-D plane, and somehow knowing when I can bail out of the search early?",

I know how to convert it to decimal and how to add bytes together.\n\nWhat I don't get is how binary is the basis of computer programming. \n\nFrom my understanding, computers operate by pulsing electricity through circuits. Each circuit has  logic gates that operate differently depending on the binary input. An \"and\" gate opens when the 2 input wires are true (1). An \"xor\" gate only opens when 1 or the other wire is true, but not when they both are or are not. \n\nI just don't get how binary code can operate the entire system. For instance, your press the \"5\" key on your laptop. A 5 appears on your screen. That 5 exists because a certain amount of pixels on your monitor were programmed to change colors when the 5 key was pressed. How does that work? \n\nThere are only 256 values a byte can hold. Are modern computer programs just the result of highly complex circuitry that only rely on the 256 values? Can the 256 values of a byte be enough to create complex logic systems that have billions of outcomes? \n\nHardware reads binary and sends out electric pulses based on the input. Software is various ways to code binary? Operating systems assign certain values to each byte. Then other software uses the operating systems \"new\" code to create new values? But all it is really doing is adding new logic gates on each circuit to create new outcomes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't know. I am taking a tech bootcamp to change careers. I am really excited to learn about computers and how to code, but I am worried I won't be able to do it if I can't understand binary and how it is at the center of computers. I was asked to describe how a computer counts and adds. I understand how to do that in binary, but I don't understand how a computer does it. I know there are circuits, gates, registers, alu's, cpu's, clocks, etc. I am just having a hard time understanding the whole concept.",

I like writing sci fi and fantasy and the names aren't always the most simple so I thought it would be cool if I could just type the first few characters and then tab the rest of it speeding up the typing process. My main thought would be that the user would have to type and save all of the character names and locations that they want in a separate file and then the program would essentially be constantly checking each thing that is typed for matches.

            "score": 3,
            "selftext": "Hey all - I'm after advice on 'how to learn/get into programming'.\n\nI'll break it down for more context. Sorry for the lengthy life story...\n\nI've always had an interest in programming since a teen. Dabbled in a few small bits around the age of 13/14, secondary school happened and never really touched it again. Fast forward about 10 years and I decided to pick it up again and actually do something about it. I went back to college, then onto university to get a degree in games technology. During my time at uni, I worked on quite a few different projects such as AI, Maths for Games, graphics, PS4 DevKits, and a few personal projects. My uni and personal projects mostly focused on C++ with a bit of C# thrown in here and there.\n\nI finished university with a 1st so all is well. You may be thinking \"Why do you need advice? You seem capable?\" Well, here is where things get 'tricky'.\n\nDuring my 3 years at university, I tried to balance several modules at once and they changed the teaching structure halfway through to make modules even more stressful with less time. Because I was so scared of failing, I'd continuously ask for help (reason why I got the 1st) so I wouldn't fail a module and have to repeat. Currently, I can look at code and know what's happening (depending on the complexity). But when it comes to implementing something, that's where I fall over and get stuck. I know it's probably the simple thing of \"just practice\" which I 100% agree with. But with how complex programming can be, I do find it quite overwhelming and often find myself looking at the same thing over and over to drill it in and often find it difficult on where to start/what resources to look at. Talking about C++, there's so many elements to it such as Classes, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstract classes, pointers, data types, Lambda functions, functors, and so much more which I can't think of.\n\nI'm 30 this year and I've been working in the games industry for almost 3 years. My role does involve some programming (when needed), but I often find myself struggling a lot and makes me super anxious. You might be thinking \"How'd you land the job...?\". I started in QA, moved to more development focused team, and landed a new role. The role doesn't strictly involve programming, but there are elements of it.  I'm trying to avoid tutorials for things as I don't really feel like they help. So in my UE5 project, I'm taking the approach of \"research it, rather than find a copy-paste solution\". For example, if I want to get a character moving, I'd research what is involved in a player component (vectors, input, etc). I know engines do this stuff easily, but I'm trying to understand the logic behind something and then trying to implement it. Which at times, can fall into a rabbit hole.\n\nI do suffer from imposter syndrome a lot and does hit me hard. I wish I could ignore it, but at times I can't and it actually stops me from learning. Most of the time, I feel like I'm too old and should look at something else. Most people I know started programming at the age of 13, continued programming and are really good. \n\nAs it stands, I'm currently reading through some C++ books and doing some stuff in Unreal Engine. Jumping into a game engine probably isn't the best idea, but I'd rather do something than nothing. I often thought about giving it up and doing something else, but I hate giving up and want to make it happen.\n\nWhat I'm asking is mostly, if anyone has been in the same shoes as me, what did you do to over come the 'hump'? How did you 'learn' how to program? What resources did you use? And what advice do you have for me?\n\nI appreciate your time.",

I have a button that triggers the function and the function alse triggers on window-load. The problem is that when the window loads, the HTML points that are supposed to be the city and state are \"undefined\". But when I press the button to fire the event, it works and the state and city are displayed correctly.\n\n\nThis is the function that contains the sub-functions and the order they trigger in\n\n    const successCallback = (position) => {\n        information.latitude = parseFloat(position.coords.latitude\n        );\n        information.longitude = parseFloat(position.coords.longitude);\n        getLocation(information.latitude, information.longitude);\n        changeLocation();\n    }\n\n\nThese are the functions themselves\n\n\n\n    function getLocation(lat, lon) {\n        fetch(`https://api.bigdatacloud.net/data/reverse-geocode-client? \n    latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lon}&localityLanguage=en`)\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(response => {\n            information.state = response.principalSubdivision;\n        })\n        .catch(err => console.error(err));\n\n        fetch(`https://geocodeapi.p.rapidapi.com/GetNearestCities? \n    latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lon}&range=0`, options)\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(response => {\n            information.city = response[0].City;\n        })\n        .catch(err => console.error(err));\n    }\n\n    function changeLocation() {\n        document.getElementById('top-left-location').innerHTML =\n        `${information.city}, ${information.state}`;\n\n        document.getElementById('main-location-info').innerHTML =\n        `${information.city}, ${information.state}`;\n    }\n\n\nI've figured out that the problem has something to do with the getLocation function assigning the state and city values to the information object and the changeLocation function consequently outputting undefined, making the overall function have to fire twice before it actually works. I just can't figure out how to fix it. Any advice?\n\n\nEDIT: After some more testing, I've figured out the problem isn't necessarily tied to the window.onload aspect. Whether it's the window.load + a button press or two button presses, the function has to fire twice for it to display the location correctly. On the first fire, it always displays undefined and on the second fire, it always displays the correct information. What could be causing this?",

I am a CompSci junior student, I have to get a job/internship ASAP due to some financial issues.\nI learnt HTML/CSS over the top and have a fair idea about it, I have been trying to learn JavaScript, but I genuinely just find it really hard to learn it. I constantly feel like not learning it or that I am only learning it since many other people are doing it. I feel stressed anytime someone talks about projects, my self esteem goes so low that I tear up. I am tired of trying to force myself and direct all my mental energy in constantly trying to \"re-start\" learning JavaScript. I don't really find web development appealing but it seems like if I don't learn it, I won't have any projects to put on my resume. I recently started to leetcode and learn Java on the side, I liked doing it a bit but at the end of day projects and concrete skills are required to get a job. I really need some help on how do I exactly start making applications and use JavaScript plus learn it. I have exactly 4 or 5 months to learn. Please help!\nI also tend not to sit for too long, not sure what that problem is, but I tend to get annoyed/agitated very easily, I think it might be because the resources I seek to are harder to grasp, so any sort of links to good and simplified resources would be really appreciated!",

I have no clue which I set up correctly, which not, etc... it was usually presented in courses in a way that you strictly follow the steps... and never do it again. I know I set up this stuff for Python 3 years ago, but I have no clue if I needed to use it again if it would still work... or how to set up these things now on my own.\n\nNow, for example, I also need to set up a compiler for C, but I don't even know if I've already set up something in the past... perhaps incorrectly... I just know that I can't compile C code in Windows... but I also know I downloaded and tried to set up various compilers, but there was always some problem, and the thing remained unfinished.\n\nThe thing is, I would like to truly UNDERSTAND how it works, so that I can easily be sure what I have installed and what not, and to know exactly how to set up the things that I did install...\n\nNow terminals also frustrate me, because various courses introduced DIFFERENT terminals, that all have some details regarding how to set up various compilers, interpreters, etc...\n\nI've tried Hyper, PowerShall, etc... but I don't truly understand how it all works (I just know some commands), if they can be in conflict with each other... how it works with terminal in Visual Studio Code, etc...

Maybe there is a way to achieve this without having to read the whole list of persistant-apps?",

I have some free time I can pull off during the day, sometimes it can get to 6 hours a day dedicated to learn programming. \n\nI wanted to be able to \"simulate\" the first semesters of a CS degree on my own, following along [this](https://github.com/Universidade-Livre/ciencia-da-computacao) Brazillian repo \"Universidade Livre\" or \"Free University\". I don't know if this is a good idea, if I should focus on more pratical projects to be able to find a job quickly like some other people I know from this sub, and I really want your opinion on that.\n\nI'm trying to organize myself to be able to attend the following courses during the next weeks: \n\n* [Harvard CS50x Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)(I'm currently on the fifth week of the course);\n* [Harvard CS50P Introduction to Computer Science in Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) (this would be to dig into Python, which is a language I like and it's being frequently used nowadays);\n* [Fundamentals of mathematics for computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE6ruiq632o&list=PLrOyM49ctTx-HWypJVvn_zMO1o7oOAfVx) (Not sure about this one because it's only on youtube - maybe I should try something with a certificate)\n* [Digital Circuits](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXyWBo_coJnMYO9Na3t-oYsc2X4kPJBWf) (same as above)\n* [Google's Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/home/week/1) (This one I'm only doing for the certificate)\n\nAlso, I wanted to start learning something about AWS and Cloud Computing, but maybe I would start next month. \n\nAm I missing something? Or am I completely out of mind here? I don't even know if all of this is doable, or if this will ever help me getting a job. So, am I right on focusing on the basics here? Should I also schedule some amount of time to personal projects?\n\nThank you!",

Although I am on the verge of completing a two year Computer Programming Diploma at a public college in Canada and have studied C/C++, Web development, Phyton and DBMS using Oracle SQL, I am still uncertain which direction to pursue.\n\nI find web development to be a bit tedious as I struggle with design elements and tend to spend a lot of time on CSS. I have also tried learning React and Next.js, but it has left me feeling more confused than before. Moreover more and more people are joining this field so I am uncertain of it's future.\n\nWhile I have finished studying C++, I find some of the more complex aspects to be challenging and feel frustrated while solving problems.\n\nI couldn't give enough time to Python as it wasn't included in my coursework. I have completed only the fundamentals which were easier for me to learn because I knew C++ already.\n\nDatabases interest me the most, and I found it to be straightforward, but I haven't dived deep into it yet. So I am not sure if I should shift my focus towards it.\n\nAs I prepare for upcoming co-op opportunities I am struggling to select my domain and build projects to prove my skills, I am unsure which path to take.\n\nI am hoping to gain clarity and explore my options further, as I value finding a fulfilling career that aligns with my interests and strengths.

The App component has a state called board, which is a an object, basically a 2D array representation of the board with extra function, and App also has a handleSquareClick function that creates a new instance of the board and sets it as the new state.\n\nI used React.memo to prevent the Square components from re-rendering due to props changes in their parent component.  \n\n\nBut the issue is that every time the board state changes, the App component recreates the handleSquareClick function and passes it down to the Board component, which then passes it down to all 64 Square components, causing them to re-render unnecessarily.  Whenever there is a change in the board state, the App component creates a new instance of the HandleSquareClick function, causing unnecesary re-renders.\n\nI tried using the useCallback hook to memoize the handleSquareClick function, but since it depends on the board state, passing the board as a dependency, on board update creates a new instance of a function in the same way as before, defeating the purpose of Callback.\n\nThe only solution I could think of was to move the handleSquareClick function to the Square component and pass only the setBoard function to it, which never changes. However, this solution feels ugly because the Square component shouldn't be responsible for handling the logic that the handleSquareClick function deals with.\n\nWhat would be a better way to optimize the performance of this app and avoid unnecessary re-renders of the Square components?",

I'm self aware of my faults but it's hard to be engaged, especially alone, and I don't mind spending extra time and money for a degree even if I might be qualified for a job sooner self teaching, at this point I don't really care about just getting a job I want a good understanding of computer science as well as have as getting around people with the similar intrest. That being said I looked on Youtube and school curriculums and kind of have a negative view on getting a degree (as well as people I know who got a degree), it seems like everyone who took a computer-science degree says it mostly just math and any programming you actually learn is some really niche stuff like Lisp as your first programming language. I hate Math and I have \"ADHD\" (If you believe in it) and can barley focus on anything for minutes and than get in negative thought loops because of it. I want to learn programming, should I just do the degree, I'm probably going to a community college because the drop out rate of computer science is over 50% because people realize half the time what you are learning is difficult bull shit, than I would still have to study outside of my degree because their is not going to be one class on JavaScript or a \"in demand langauge\", also new openAI models are legit better and faster than most front-end Junior devs, not many people believe AI is going to take over every job, it's a strawman, but why ever hire front-end Juniors when AI is getting exponentially better where it would figure out the bugs in code tests better than average Junior dev. I feel like shit, I wanna do something but studying alone is making me develop anti-social behaviors, but a computer science degree looks like a joke to me.\n\nIs there even a good way to be formally educated? Is a computer science degree really \"hard\", would it be smart to just do it and cheat on \"useless\" classes or do you really have to know the math to pass?",

The reason the course did not cover those topics in long lengths is because I should not do so either, because there's a good chance I may spend a lot of time learning about these topics just for it to never be relevant in my future line of work.\n\nWhich is when it kind of dawned on me: I do not know what I want to do with my life. \n\nAll I know is I want to work with computers, and in school that used to feel like enough, but realistically  with how broad \"working with computers\" is, I suddenly don't know what to do\n\nThe other courses I got off of Udemy are for Machine learning with python and Tensorflow, but I did not buy them because I specifically want to work in that field (and honestly, I'm not 100% what you even do in that field), more because I was just curious how it worked, and thought it would be \"neat\" to code my own AI's. I bought the courses, so I am going to go through it, but I am worried all I'll really learn is I hate working with AI\n\nBut then it seems like the only way to know whether or not I feel certain I want to invest into a certain branch of computers is to actively study the knowledge necessary for that field to determine if that is what I want to do. But then, if I spend a lot of my time studying these fields, and decide I want nothing to do with it, then I just wasted a lot of my limited free time\n\nAnd this is all just things relating to Python, which I might not even do anything with. Python is simple, so simple it actually frustrates me. I studied C for awhile before I started studying Python (had a hard time wrapping my head around pointers), but I feel I enjoyed coding C more than I do Python, because it felt more like I was actively telling the computer what to do instead of having the computer spend valuable computations figuring it out itself. Which makes me think: am I wasting my time even now?\n\nLong rant over. I'm not necessarily asking for advice, just wanted to get these thoughts out somewhere, although I'd be willing to accept advice if anyone has it",

The biggest drawback of web-based apps is performance, and if the performance of the Chrome Browser continues to improve, it will run as fast as a regular PC. Then I think it will be natural to develop it on a web-based basis without having to make it native.  \nWhat is the most necessary technology in this web-based world? I think it's Front-End development. Beyond just designing what you see, you'll need a lot of talented developers who can implement complex functions based on a Chrome browser, for example, to do Excel work. And I think it's the Front-End developer who can do this. Just as desktop app developers develop to match each target OS and PC performance, web-based app developers should make the most of the performance of Google Chrome browser to create a fast-running app. Skilled Web Front-End developers will need much more than they do now.\"  \nWhat do you think about this article?  \nI'm currently preparing for a job in iOS development, but I'm worried if I'm preparing for a job in mobile because I'm afraid there will be no mobile developers in the future.  \nPlease give us a lot of suggestions.",

I also want to mention that I also rarely have any time to actually work on my skills or start personal projects because I'm constantly working on assignments for classes. However, my spring break is coming up, and I'm willing to do whatever I can to break out of this plateau. What can I do to learn to become a better programmer?

I have an older Macbook pro but it is literally my life and I don't like traveling with it because I don't want to risk damaging it because I can't afford to replace it. \n\nAnywho, my question is what is the best setup that I can do so I can do school work on the Chromebook? I have not bought it yet, because I am waiting a little bit more, then I can afford it but also because I want to do my due diligence and know the facts. I want to be able to do my coding projects (for school and personal) but I am not familiar with chrome systems.\n\nThe chrome book I am looking at is the 13-inch galaxy Chromebook 2 in 1 with an i3 core proc and 8GB ram. \n\nI viewed some videos that GitHub and VS is a good setup, and I am familiar with VS but not GitHub. I just want to know all the possible sets up I can do especially for someone who is not experienced in servers like GitHub and the like. It gives me trepidation, but I know that is just because I have literally no experience in it. I just need a beginner's guide on how I could set up the Chromebook for coding/programming and what people's recommendations would be.\n\nFor what programming languages I would say (in order of importance as of right now): java, c/c++, javascript, html, css, c#, python, and pretty much all full stack engineer languages I forgot and don't know about yet. As I said I am a student so I will need a variety of languages and I only really have knowledge that VS has that.  Plus I like trying out new languages and fiddling around with them and learning on my own.  Also, I want to fiddle with app making so if you have a recommendation of where I can do that for noobs would be appreciated.\n\nAny videos, advice, tips, etc will be appreciated. Thank you!",

Spent a few months learning all the basics, then started learning C with the book C Programming, a Modern Approach. Got to chapter 16 or so in the book, doing all the questions and projects. I am now struggling to get back into it after a 2 month break, C is a fucking headache. Would it be dumb to pick up another language, say Java or C++, or would I be better off going back to Python so life is a bit easier? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really have any project ideas at the moment, or anything I'm working on that I'm too interested in. I want to keep programming because it's what I want to do as a career and I do really enjoy it, especially when I have something to work on, at the moment I just feel like I'm in a sort of limbo. I am sort of at a point where I know the basics and can make shit work, but I still have a long way to go before I can really make anything cool. Just feeling frustrated, looking for some advice if anyone has gone through something similar.",

DESIGN RULES: Principles + Practices for Great UI Design\n2. User Experience Design Fundamentals\n3. Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)\n4. The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert\n5. React Tutorial and Projects Course\n6. React Front To Back\n7. MERN eCommerce From Scratch\n8. MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js\n9. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass\n10. 20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript\n11. 50 Projects In 50 Days \u2013 HTML, CSS & JavaScript\n\n(if needed can add links to those udemy courses)\n\nIn those courses I built about 40 and finishing soon the next 2 courses (10 and 11) which will make it about 100 small to big Fullstack big projects. \n\nNow I have some questions:\nIs it enough? \nIs the fact those courses are a little bit outdated matter?(from 1 years to 4)\nWhat next to lend a job and should I take a last course after those to create a bigger challenge? Or even to take speciality at Javascript a bit more? \nIm feeling in some way that im afraid to write code by myself and stuck in what some call the \"tutorial hell\". \n\nWould love for any tips or guidelines. \nSorry for the length of the post btw.",

I'm planning to retrieve those with pure SQL queries. I've  created a Symfony project, a router, the base template and added a font  from Google Fonts in the page but now I've come to the issue that the  text I've written inside the page is  suddenly disappeared and now  invisible in Symfony. I've checked the DevTools of Firefox (The browser  which I use) and it's isn't visible there either. It was firstly visible  before I included a stylesheet and added a custom font from Google  Fonts but now it all disappeared. The stylesheet is loaded as usual and  the path to it is also correct. I've then tried to switch to  localhost:8000 instead of 127.0.0.1:8000 and back some times without  success. The last things I tried was to clear the cache multiple times  and recreate the entire Symfony project from scratch but all things I  tried didn't help sadly to fix my issue. I use the Symfony local  webserver as my localhost. Here's the code of the page: [https://jsfiddle.net/pv4robgx/](https://jsfiddle.net/pv4robgx/), the stylesheet:  [https://jsfiddle.net/vghtza4j/](https://jsfiddle.net/vghtza4j/), the base template: [https://jsfiddle.net/Pencoder/13vmg45q/1/](https://jsfiddle.net/Pencoder/13vmg45q/1/) and the controller: [https://jsfiddle.net/Pencoder/k87amtyx/](https://jsfiddle.net/Pencoder/k87amtyx/).

I've taken some self-directed courses on the basics of python, C, and java, but have realized I need a structured class to actually motivate myself to learn. I am not very educated at all in computer science despite my friends being amazed by my knowledge of windows settings, but I do have a profound love for the power of computing.\n\nA few general things about what I'm looking for:\n\n\\-I'm not worried about getting super rich, just supporting myself and having some to save (no plans for kids, partner is a doctor).  \n\\-I'd like to work from home as much as possible.  \n\\-Freelancing sounds more my speed, but from what I've heard, availability depends heavily on what field you're in.  \n\\-I love video games, but I'm not sure that I'm very interested in game design, and I assume that freelancing and game design generally don't go together.  \n\\-I don't think I really care to be super passionate about the projects I work on, more that there is relatively consistent work that I can complete confidently. Having never been in this world, I'm not totally sure if this is true or not.\n\nAny suggestions on fields to look into or explanations why items in the list above might be shortsighted or incorrect would be greatly appreciated. \n\nMy apologies if I missed something in the \"READ ME FIRST\" post about posting here.",

It's a bit of a hybrid between Miro (creating your own cards) and Trello (Updating the cards) meets Settlers of Catan (for style with the honeycombs) for a very niche usecase.\n\nAnyway: So for the grid I wanted to have the cards/tiles Drag&Drop easily. and got caught up in all kinds of Javascript libraries and then got stuck on how to keep track of where each tile was located and then had to work out some kind of collision detection so that if users created a new card it would not overlap. and the complexity continued and I thought it would never work.\n\nThen I realised something profound:- A list that wraps to a new line every N items becomes a grid. Now the problem of X/Y coordinates simply becomes a problem of what is this items place in the list. So I went for that!\n\nI now use HTMX sortable. So basically all my tiles are 1 big list. And due to line wrapping every 11th card end up at a new row, creating a grid. All the \"background\" cards are just empty divs without a background. I use swap so that it does not affect the entire order of the list but just swaps the 2 cards involved.\n\nEvery time we change a item we send a quick post message to the backend with the new order of items. And that is how I persist them. I'm now only struggling with screen sizes as my tiles and the div framing them have to be specific sizes in order for the grid to work. But hey it works!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short: This might seem hacky, but it works extremely well for my usecase. I was afraid of complex javascript libraries or frameworks. And now simply use Django templates and HTMX.\n\nWhat do you people think? And what approach would you take if you were implementing dragable grid items? Also: if anyone has a idea on how I can make the page responsive while maintaining the amount of items in a row that would be great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    <style type=\"text/css\">\n        .gridmain {\n            display:flex;\n            flex-wrap: nowrap;\n            --s: 100px;  /* size  */\n            --m: 1px;    /* margin */\n            --f: calc(1.732 * var(--s) + 4 * var(--m)  - 1px);\n            padding-bottom: 50px;\n        }\n    \n        .gridcontainer {\n          font-size: 0; /*disable white space between inline block element */\n          width: 1530px; /* We need a fixed size so we know that the divs won't overflow*/\n          height: 750px; /* We need a fixed size so we know that the divs won't overflow*/\n        }\n    \n        .gridcontainer div {\n          width: var(--s);\n          margin: var(--m);\n          height: calc(var(--s)*1.1547); \n          display: inline-block;\n          font-size:initial;\n          clip-path: polygon(0% 25%, 0% 75%, 50% 100%, 100% 75%, 100% 25%, 50% 0%);\n          margin-bottom: calc(var(--m) - var(--s)*0.2885); \n          overflow: hidden;\n        }\n        /*\n        .gridcontainer div:nth-child(odd) {\n          background:green;\n        }\n        */\n        .gridcontainer::before {\n          content: \"\";\n          width: calc(var(--s)/2 + var(--m));\n          float: left;\n          height: 120%;\n          shape-outside: repeating-linear-gradient(     \n                           #0000 0 calc(var(--f) - 3px),      \n                           #000  0 var(--f));\n        }\n        .hexagonhidden {\n            padding-top: 50px;\n            text-align: center;\n            vertical-align: middle;\n            color: #fff;\n            font-size: 1;\n            \n        }\n        .hexagonhidden:hover{\n            background-color:#78E7BF;\n            opacity: 0.5;\n            padding-top: 45px;\n        }\n        .hexagon {\n            padding-top: 10px;\n            text-align: center;\n            vertical-align: middle;\n            color: #000000;\n        }\n    </style>\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"gridmain\">\n            <form class=\"gridcontainer sortable\" hx-post=\"/dashboard/update\" hx-trigger=\"end\">\n            {% for card in cards %}\n            {% if card.cardtype == 'empty' %}\n                <div class=\"hexagonhidden\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>   \n                    <i class=\"fa-regular fa-2xl fa-plus\"></i><br>         \n                </div>\n            {% elif card.cardtype == 'ambition' %}\n                <div class=\"hexagon\" style=\"background: #000000; color: #fff\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>            \n                    <i class=\"fa-solid fa-xl fa-eye\"></i><br>\n                    {{ card.title}}\n                </div>\n            {% elif card.cardtype == 'challenge' %}E6799D\n                <div class=\"hexagon\" style=\"background: #E6799D;\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>            \n                    <i class=\"fa-regular fa-xl fa-mountain\"></i><br>\n                    {{ card.title}}\n                </div>\n            {% elif card.cardtype == 'idea' %}\n                <div class=\"hexagon\" style=\"background: #51c1ff;\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>            \n                    <i class=\"fa-regular fa-lightbulb fa-xl\"></i><br>\n                    {{ card.title}}\n                </div>\n            {% elif card.cardtype == 'pro' %}\n                <div class=\"hexagon\" style=\"background: #ffeb39;\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>            \n                    <i class=\"fa-regular fa-lightbulb fa-xl\"></i><br>\n                    {{ card.title}}\n                </div>\n                {% elif card.cardtype == 'con' %}\n                <div class=\"hexagon\" style=\"background: red;\"><input type='hidden' name='item' value='{{ card.id}}'/>            \n                    <i class=\"fa-regular fa-lightbulb fa-xl\"></i><br>\n                    {{ card.title}}\n                </div>\n            {% endif %}\n            {% endfor %}\n            </form>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n&#x200B;",

Where would be the best place to learn to go forward with this? And is it possible to also implement my basics of Python into this so I can develop my skills in Python along side the web development side of things like HTML for example.\n\nI understand this is likely a wide open question but everything you look into online is just full of information saying one thing or the other and generally just a bit confused how to start and where to go from my point.\n\nThe things I learned in Python were the basics of how data is used like strings, values, learned how to use functions, learned how to store data in lists and dictionaries and generally the basics but didn't get too far to be building my own programs apart from a username & password creator where it was stored in a dictionary and then could be used to login, it was simply a test to see if I was storing data correctly.\n\nAny advice from your own experience would be appreciated so I can take that forward as well.\n\nAlso to clear things up has I got asked this last time I posted here last year, I'm not looking to get into this professional it is something I want to learn has I'm interested over the course of the next few years to see where this leads.\n\nThank you",

I have been struggling to get project ideas or what to learn, I feel like I\u2019ve hit a roadblock. I could advance my html,css,js code but don\u2019t know where to start, and I\u2019ve been trying python graphics but it\u2019s complicated for me. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEdit: My main goal is to create things in code like web and app development",
